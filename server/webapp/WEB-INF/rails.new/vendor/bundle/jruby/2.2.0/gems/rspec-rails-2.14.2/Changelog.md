Bug fixes

* Fixes "warning: instance variable @orig\_routes not initialized" raised by

  (Darryl Pogue)

* Explicitly depends on `activemodel`. This allows libraries that do not bring

  (Rudolf Schmidt)

### 2.12.2 / 2013-01-12
[full changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/compare/v2.12.1...v2.12.2)

Bug fixes

* Reverts earlier fix where anonymous controllers defined the `_routes` method
  to support testing of redirection and generation of URLs from other contexts.
  The implementation ended up breaking the ability to refer to non-anonymous

* The controller spec generated with `rails generate scaffold namespaced::model`
  matches the spec generated with `rails generate scaffold namespaced/model`
  (Kohei Hasegawa)

Bug fixes

* "uninitialized constant" errors are avoided when using using gems like
  `rspec-rails-uncommitted` that define `Rspec::Rails` before `rspec-rails`
  loads (Andy Lindeman)
