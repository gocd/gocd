    # == Backburner adapter for Active Job
    #
    # Backburner is a beanstalkd-powered job queue that can handle a very
    # high volume of jobs. You create background jobs and place them on
    # multiple work queues to be processed later. Read more about
    # Backburner {here}[https://github.com/nesquena/backburner].
    #
    # To use Backburner set the queue_adapter config to +:backburner+.
    #
    #   Rails.application.config.active_job.queue_adapter = :backburner
