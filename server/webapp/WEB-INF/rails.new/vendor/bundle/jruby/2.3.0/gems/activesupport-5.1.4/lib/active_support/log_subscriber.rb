module ActiveSupport
  # ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber is an object set to consume
  # ActiveSupport::Notifications with the sole purpose of logging them.
  # The log subscriber dispatches notifications to a registered object based
  # on its given namespace.
  #
  # An example would be Active Record log subscriber responsible for logging
  # queries:
  #
  #   module ActiveRecord
  #     class LogSubscriber < ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber
  #       def sql(event)
  #         "#{event.payload[:name]} (#{event.duration}) #{event.payload[:sql]}"
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # And it's finally registered as:
  #
  #   ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber.attach_to :active_record
  #
  # Since we need to know all instance methods before attaching the log
  # subscriber, the line above should be called after your
  # <tt>ActiveRecord::LogSubscriber</tt> definition.
  #
  # After configured, whenever a "sql.active_record" notification is published,
  # it will properly dispatch the event (ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event) to
  # the sql method.
  #
  # Log subscriber also has some helpers to deal with logging and automatically
  # flushes all logs when the request finishes (via action_dispatch.callback
  # notification) in a Rails environment.

    # Embed in a String to clear all previous ANSI sequences.
