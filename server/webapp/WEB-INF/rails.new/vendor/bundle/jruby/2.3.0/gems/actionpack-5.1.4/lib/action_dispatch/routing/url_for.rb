module ActionDispatch
  module Routing
    # In <tt>config/routes.rb</tt> you define URL-to-controller mappings, but the reverse
    # is also possible: a URL can be generated from one of your routing definitions.
    # URL generation functionality is centralized in this module.
    #
    # See ActionDispatch::Routing for general information about routing and routes.rb.
    #
    # <b>Tip:</b> If you need to generate URLs from your models or some other place,
    # then ActionController::UrlFor is what you're looking for. Read on for
    # an introduction. In general, this module should not be included on its own,
    # as it is usually included by url_helpers (as in Rails.application.routes.url_helpers).
    #
    # == URL generation from parameters
    #
    # As you may know, some functions, such as ActionController::Base#url_for
    # and ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper#link_to, can generate URLs given a set
    # of parameters. For example, you've probably had the chance to write code
    # like this in one of your views:
    #
    #   <%= link_to('Click here', controller: 'users',
    #           action: 'new', message: 'Welcome!') %>
    #   # => <a href="/users/new?message=Welcome%21">Click here</a>
    #
    # link_to, and all other functions that require URL generation functionality,
    # actually use ActionController::UrlFor under the hood. And in particular,
    # they use the ActionController::UrlFor#url_for method. One can generate
    # the same path as the above example by using the following code:
    #
    #   include UrlFor
    #   url_for(controller: 'users',
    #           action: 'new',
    #           message: 'Welcome!',
    #           only_path: true)
    #   # => "/users/new?message=Welcome%21"
    #
    # Notice the <tt>only_path: true</tt> part. This is because UrlFor has no
    # information about the website hostname that your Rails app is serving. So if you
    # want to include the hostname as well, then you must also pass the <tt>:host</tt>
    # argument:
    #
    #   include UrlFor
    #   url_for(controller: 'users',
    #           action: 'new',
    #           message: 'Welcome!',
    #           host: 'www.example.com')
    #   # => "http://www.example.com/users/new?message=Welcome%21"
    #
    # By default, all controllers and views have access to a special version of url_for,
    # that already knows what the current hostname is. So if you use url_for in your
    # controllers or your views, then you don't need to explicitly pass the <tt>:host</tt>
    # argument.
    #
    # For convenience reasons, mailers provide a shortcut for ActionController::UrlFor#url_for.
    # So within mailers, you only have to type +url_for+ instead of 'ActionController::UrlFor#url_for'
    # in full. However, mailers don't have hostname information, and you still have to provide
    # the +:host+ argument or set the default host that will be used in all mailers using the
    # configuration option +config.action_mailer.default_url_options+. For more information on
    # url_for in mailers read the ActionMailer#Base documentation.
    #
    #
    # == URL generation for named routes
    #
    # UrlFor also allows one to access methods that have been auto-generated from
    # named routes. For example, suppose that you have a 'users' resource in your
    # <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>:
    #
    #   resources :users
    #
    # This generates, among other things, the method <tt>users_path</tt>. By default,
    # this method is accessible from your controllers, views and mailers. If you need
    # to access this auto-generated method from other places (such as a model), then
    # you can do that by including Rails.application.routes.url_helpers in your class:
    #
    #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers
    #
    #     def base_uri
    #       user_path(self)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   User.find(1).base_uri # => "/users/1"
    #

            class_attribute :default_url_options
          else

      # Generate a url based on the options provided, default_url_options and the
      # routes defined in routes.rb. The following options are supported:
      #
      # * <tt>:only_path</tt> - If true, the relative url is returned. Defaults to +false+.
      # * <tt>:protocol</tt> - The protocol to connect to. Defaults to 'http'.
      # * <tt>:host</tt> - Specifies the host the link should be targeted at.
      #   If <tt>:only_path</tt> is false, this option must be
      #   provided either explicitly, or via +default_url_options+.
      # * <tt>:subdomain</tt> - Specifies the subdomain of the link, using the +tld_length+
      #   to split the subdomain from the host.
      #   If false, removes all subdomains from the host part of the link.
      # * <tt>:domain</tt> - Specifies the domain of the link, using the +tld_length+
      #   to split the domain from the host.
      # * <tt>:tld_length</tt> - Number of labels the TLD id composed of, only used if
      #   <tt>:subdomain</tt> or <tt>:domain</tt> are supplied. Defaults to
      #   <tt>ActionDispatch::Http::URL.tld_length</tt>, which in turn defaults to 1.
      # * <tt>:port</tt> - Optionally specify the port to connect to.
      # * <tt>:anchor</tt> - An anchor name to be appended to the path.
      # * <tt>:trailing_slash</tt> - If true, adds a trailing slash, as in "/archive/2009/"
      # * <tt>:script_name</tt> - Specifies application path relative to domain root. If provided, prepends application path.

      # through `GET /users/1`:

      #
      # Notice that no +:id+ parameter was provided to the first +url_for+ call
