    # A cache store implementation which doesn't actually store anything. Useful in
    # development and test environments where you don't want caching turned on but
    # need to go through the caching interface.

    # be cached inside blocks that utilize this strategy. See
    # ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache for more details.
