    # Executes a custom SQL query against your database and returns all the results. The results will
    # be returned as an array with columns requested encapsulated as attributes of the model you call
    # this method from. If you call <tt>Product.find_by_sql</tt> then the results will be returned in
    # a +Product+ object with the attributes you specified in the SQL query.
    #
    # If you call a complicated SQL query which spans multiple tables the columns specified by the
    # SELECT will be attributes of the model, whether or not they are columns of the corresponding
    # table.
    #
    # The +sql+ parameter is a full SQL query as a string. It will be called as is, there will be
    # no database agnostic conversions performed. This should be a last resort because using, for example,
    # MySQL specific terms will lock you to using that particular database engine or require you to
    # change your call if you switch engines.
    #
    #   # A simple SQL query spanning multiple tables
    #   Post.find_by_sql "SELECT p.title, c.author FROM posts p, comments c WHERE p.id = c.post_id"
    #   # => [#<Post:0x36bff9c @attributes={"title"=>"Ruby Meetup", "first_name"=>"Quentin"}>, ...]
    #
    # You can use the same string replacement techniques as you can with <tt>ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#where</tt>:
    #
    #   Post.find_by_sql ["SELECT title FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created > ?", author_id, start_date]
