== Creating the test database

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection adapter setups you want to test with in 
test/connections/<your database>/connection.rb. 
When you have the database online, you can import the fixture tables with 
the test/schema/*.sql files.

Make sure that you create database objects with the same user that you specified in 
connection.rb otherwise (on Postgres, at least) tests for default values will fail.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all the adapters. You can also run the suite on just
one adapter by using the tasks test_mysql, test_sqlite, test_postgresql or any
of the other test_ tasks. For more information, checkout the full array of rake
tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in test/cases directory. If you only want to run a single test suite, 
you can do so with:

   rake test_mysql TEST=test/cases/base_test.rb
   
That'll run the base suite using the MySQL-Ruby adapter.  Some tests rely on the schema
being initialized - you can initialize the schema with:

  rake test_mysql TEST=test/cases/aaa_create_tables_test.rb
