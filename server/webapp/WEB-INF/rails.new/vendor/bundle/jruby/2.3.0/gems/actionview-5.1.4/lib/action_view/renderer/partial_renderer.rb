  # = Action View Partials
  #
  # There's also a convenience method for rendering sub templates within the current controller that depends on a
  # single object (we call this kind of sub templates for partials). It relies on the fact that partials should
  # follow the naming convention of being prefixed with an underscore -- as to separate them from regular
  # templates that could be rendered on their own.
  #
  # In a template for Advertiser#account:
  #
  #  <%= render partial: "account" %>
  #
  # This would render "advertiser/_account.html.erb".
  #
  # In another template for Advertiser#buy, we could have:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "account", locals: { account: @buyer } %>
  #
  #   <% @advertisements.each do |ad| %>
  #     <%= render partial: "ad", locals: { ad: ad } %>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # This would first render "advertiser/_account.html.erb" with @buyer passed in as the local variable +account+, then
  # render "advertiser/_ad.html.erb" and pass the local variable +ad+ to the template for display.
  #
  # == The :as and :object options
  #
  # By default <tt>ActionView::PartialRenderer</tt> doesn't have any local variables.
  # The <tt>:object</tt> option can be used to pass an object to the partial. For instance:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "account", object: @buyer %>
  #
  # would provide the <tt>@buyer</tt> object to the partial, available under the local variable +account+ and is
  # equivalent to:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "account", locals: { account: @buyer } %>
  #
  # With the <tt>:as</tt> option we can specify a different name for said local variable. For example, if we
  # wanted it to be +user+ instead of +account+ we'd do:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "account", object: @buyer, as: 'user' %>
  #
  # This is equivalent to
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "account", locals: { user: @buyer } %>
  #
  # == \Rendering a collection of partials
  #
  # The example of partial use describes a familiar pattern where a template needs to iterate over an array and
  # render a sub template for each of the elements. This pattern has been implemented as a single method that
  # accepts an array and renders a partial by the same name as the elements contained within. So the three-lined
  # example in "Using partials" can be rewritten with a single line:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "ad", collection: @advertisements %>
  #
  # This will render "advertiser/_ad.html.erb" and pass the local variable +ad+ to the template for display. An
  # iteration object will automatically be made available to the template with a name of the form
  # +partial_name_iteration+. The iteration object has knowledge about which index the current object has in
  # the collection and the total size of the collection. The iteration object also has two convenience methods,
  # +first?+ and +last?+. In the case of the example above, the template would be fed +ad_iteration+.
  # For backwards compatibility the +partial_name_counter+ is still present and is mapped to the iteration's
  # +index+ method.
  #
  # The <tt>:as</tt> option may be used when rendering partials.
  #
  # You can specify a partial to be rendered between elements via the <tt>:spacer_template</tt> option.
  # The following example will render <tt>advertiser/_ad_divider.html.erb</tt> between each ad partial:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "ad", collection: @advertisements, spacer_template: "ad_divider" %>
  #
  # If the given <tt>:collection</tt> is +nil+ or empty, <tt>render</tt> will return nil. This will allow you
  # to specify a text which will be displayed instead by using this form:
  #
  #   <%= render(partial: "ad", collection: @advertisements) || "There's no ad to be displayed" %>
  #
  # NOTE: Due to backwards compatibility concerns, the collection can't be one of hashes. Normally you'd also
  # just keep domain objects, like Active Records, in there.
  #
  # == \Rendering shared partials
  #
  # Two controllers can share a set of partials and render them like this:
  #
  #   <%= render partial: "advertisement/ad", locals: { ad: @advertisement } %>
  #
  # This will render the partial "advertisement/_ad.html.erb" regardless of which controller this is being called from.
  #
  # == \Rendering objects that respond to `to_partial_path`
  #
  # Instead of explicitly naming the location of a partial, you can also let PartialRenderer do the work
  # and pick the proper path by checking `to_partial_path` method.
  #
  #  # @account.to_partial_path returns 'accounts/account', so it can be used to replace:
  #  # <%= render partial: "accounts/account", locals: { account: @account} %>
  #  <%= render partial: @account %>
  #
  #  # @posts is an array of Post instances, so every post record returns 'posts/post' on `to_partial_path`,
  #  # that's why we can replace:
  #  # <%= render partial: "posts/post", collection: @posts %>
  #  <%= render partial: @posts %>
  #
  # == \Rendering the default case
  #
  # If you're not going to be using any of the options like collections or layouts, you can also use the short-hand
  # defaults of render to render partials. Examples:
  #
  #  # Instead of <%= render partial: "account" %>
  #  <%= render "account" %>
  #
  #  # Instead of <%= render partial: "account", locals: { account: @buyer } %>
  #  <%= render "account", account: @buyer %>
  #
  #  # @account.to_partial_path returns 'accounts/account', so it can be used to replace:
  #  # <%= render partial: "accounts/account", locals: { account: @account} %>
  #  <%= render @account %>
  #
  #  # @posts is an array of Post instances, so every post record returns 'posts/post' on `to_partial_path`,
  #  # that's why we can replace:
  #  # <%= render partial: "posts/post", collection: @posts %>
  #  <%= render @posts %>
  #
  # == \Rendering partials with layouts
  #
  # Partials can have their own layouts applied to them. These layouts are different than the ones that are
  # specified globally for the entire action, but they work in a similar fashion. Imagine a list with two types
  # of users:
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/index.html.erb %>
  #   Here's the administrator:
  #   <%= render partial: "user", layout: "administrator", locals: { user: administrator } %>
  #
  #   Here's the editor:
  #   <%= render partial: "user", layout: "editor", locals: { user: editor } %>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_user.html.erb %>
  #   Name: <%= user.name %>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_administrator.html.erb %>
  #   <div id="administrator">
  #     Budget: $<%= user.budget %>
  #     <%= yield %>
  #   </div>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_editor.html.erb %>
  #   <div id="editor">
  #     Deadline: <%= user.deadline %>
  #     <%= yield %>
  #   </div>
  #
  # ...this will return:
  #
  #   Here's the administrator:
  #   <div id="administrator">
  #     Budget: $<%= user.budget %>
  #     Name: <%= user.name %>
  #   </div>
  #
  #   Here's the editor:
  #   <div id="editor">
  #     Deadline: <%= user.deadline %>
  #     Name: <%= user.name %>
  #   </div>
  #
  # If a collection is given, the layout will be rendered once for each item in
  # the collection. For example, these two snippets have the same output:
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_user.html.erb %>
  #   Name: <%= user.name %>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/index.html.erb %>
  #   <%# This does not use layouts %>
  #   <ul>
  #     <% users.each do |user| -%>
  #       <li>
  #         <%= render partial: "user", locals: { user: user } %>
  #       </li>
  #     <% end -%>
  #   </ul>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_li_layout.html.erb %>
  #   <li>
  #     <%= yield %>
  #   </li>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/index.html.erb %>
  #   <ul>
  #     <%= render partial: "user", layout: "li_layout", collection: users %>
  #   </ul>
  #
  # Given two users whose names are Alice and Bob, these snippets return:
  #
  #   <ul>
  #     <li>
  #       Name: Alice
  #     </li>
  #     <li>
  #       Name: Bob
  #     </li>
  #   </ul>
  #
  # The current object being rendered, as well as the object_counter, will be
  # available as local variables inside the layout template under the same names
  # as available in the partial.
  #
  # You can also apply a layout to a block within any template:
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_chief.html.erb %>
  #   <%= render(layout: "administrator", locals: { user: chief }) do %>
  #     Title: <%= chief.title %>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # ...this will return:
  #
  #   <div id="administrator">
  #     Budget: $<%= user.budget %>
  #     Title: <%= chief.name %>
  #   </div>
  #
  # As you can see, the <tt>:locals</tt> hash is shared between both the partial and its layout.
  #
  # If you pass arguments to "yield" then this will be passed to the block. One way to use this is to pass
  # an array to layout and treat it as an enumerable.
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_user.html.erb %>
  #   <div class="user">
  #     Budget: $<%= user.budget %>
  #     <%= yield user %>
  #   </div>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/index.html.erb %>
  #   <%= render layout: @users do |user| %>
  #     Title: <%= user.title %>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # This will render the layout for each user and yield to the block, passing the user, each time.
  #
  # You can also yield multiple times in one layout and use block arguments to differentiate the sections.
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/_user.html.erb %>
  #   <div class="user">
  #     <%= yield user, :header %>
  #     Budget: $<%= user.budget %>
  #     <%= yield user, :footer %>
  #   </div>
  #
  #   <%# app/views/users/index.html.erb %>
  #   <%= render layout: @users do |user, section| %>
  #     <%- case section when :header -%>
  #       Title: <%= user.title %>
  #     <%- when :footer -%>
  #       Deadline: <%= user.deadline %>
  #     <%- end -%>
  #   <% end %>
