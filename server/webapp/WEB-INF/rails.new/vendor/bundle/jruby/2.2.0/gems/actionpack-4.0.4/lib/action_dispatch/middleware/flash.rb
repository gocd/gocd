  # The flash provides a way to pass temporary objects between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed
  # to the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts, such as a create
  # action that sets <tt>flash[:notice] = "Post successfully created"</tt> before redirecting to a display action that can
  # then expose the flash to its template. Actually, that exposure is automatically done.
  #
  #   class PostsController < ActionController::Base
  #     def create
  #       # save post
  #       flash[:notice] = "Post successfully created"
  #       redirect_to @post
  #     end
  #
  #     def show
  #       # doesn't need to assign the flash notice to the template, that's done automatically
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   show.html.erb
  #     <% if flash[:notice] %>
  #       <div class="notice"><%= flash[:notice] %></div>
  #     <% end %>
  #
  # Since the +notice+ and +alert+ keys are a common idiom, convenience accessors are available:
  #
  #   flash.alert = "You must be logged in"
  #   flash.notice = "Post successfully created"
  #
  # This example just places a string in the flash, but you can put any object in there. And of course, you can put as
  # many as you like at a time too. Just remember: They'll be gone by the time the next action has been performed.
  #
  # See docs on the FlashHash class for more details about the flash.
