* Support for Ruby 1.8.7 and prior has been dropped

## 1.2.1 (2012-04-14)

* Declaring encoding in html5/scrub.rb. Without this, use of the ruby -KU option would cause havoc. (#32)


## 1.2.0 (2011-08-08)

Enhancements:

* Loofah::Helpers.sanitize_css is a replacement for Rails's built-in sanitize_css helper.
* Improving ActionView integration.


## 1.1.0 (2011-08-08)

Enhancements:

* Additional HTML5lib whitelist elements (from html5lib 1524:80b5efe26230).
  Up to date with HTML5lib ruby code as of 1723:7ee6a0331856.
* Whitelists (which are not part of the public API) are now Sets (were previously Arrays).
* Don't explode when encountering UTF-8 URIs. (#25, #29)


## 1.0.0 (2010-10-26)

Notes:

* Moved ActiveRecord functionality into `loofah-activerecord` gem.
* Removed DEPRECATIONS.rdoc documenting 0.3.0 API changes.


## 0.4.7 (2010-03-09)

Enhancements:

* New methods Loofah::HTML::Document#to_text and
  Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#to_text do the right thing with
  whitespace. Note that these methods are significantly slower than
  #text. GH #12
* Loofah::Elements::BLOCK_LEVEL contains a canonical list of HTML4 block-level4 elements.
* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text
  will return unescaped HTML entities by passing :encode_special_chars => false.


## 0.4.4, 0.4.5, 0.4.6 (2010-02-01)

Enhancements:

* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text now escape HTML entities.

Bug fixes:

* Loofah::XssFoliate was not properly escaping HTML entities when implicitly scrubbing a string attribute. GH #17


## 0.4.3 (2010-01-29)

Enhancements:

* All built-in scrubbers are accepted by ActiveRecord::Base.xss_foliate
* Loofah::XssFoliate.xss_foliate_all_models replaces use of the constant LOOFAH_XSS_FOLIATE_ALL_MODELS

Miscellaneous:

* Modified documentation for bootstrapping XssFoliate in a Rails app,
  since the use of Bundler breaks the previously-documented method. To
  be safe, always use an initializer file.


## 0.4.2 (2010-01-22)

Enhancements:

* Implemented Node#scrub! for scrubbing subtrees.
* Implemented NodeSet#scrub! for scrubbing a set of subtrees.
* Document.text now only serializes <body> contents (ignores <head>)
* <head>, <html> and <body> added to the HTML5lib whitelist.

Bug fixes:

* Supporting Rails apps that aren't loading ActiveRecord. GH #10

Miscellaneous:

* Mailing list is now loofah@librelist.com / http://librelist.com
* IRC channel is now \#loofah on freenode.


## 0.4.1 (2009-11-23)

* Built-in scrubbing methods refactored to use Scrubber.



## 0.3.1 (2009-10-12)

## 0.3.0 (2009-10-06)

Enhancements:

* New ActiveRecord extension `xss_foliate`, a drop-in replacement for xss_terminate[http://github.com/look/xss_terminate/tree/master].
* Replacement methods for Rails's helpers, Loofah::Rails.sanitize and Loofah::Rails.strip_tags.
* Official support (and test coverage) for Rails versions 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.2.

Deprecations:

* The methods strip_tags, whitewash, whitewash_document, sanitize, and
  sanitize_document have been deprecated. See DEPRECATED.rdoc for
  details on the equivalent calls with the post-0.2 API.


## 0.2.2 (2009-09-30)

Enhancements:

* ActiveRecord extension scrubs fields in a before_validation callback
  (was previously in a before_save)


## 0.2.1 (2009-09-19)

Enhancements:

* when loaded in a Rails app, automatically extend ActiveRecord::Base
  with html_fragment and html_document. GH #6 (Thanks Josh Nichols!)

Bugfixes:

* ActiveRecord scrubbing should generate strings instead of Document or
  DocumentFragment objects. GH #5
* init.rb fixed to support installation as a Rails plugin. GH #6
  (Thanks Josh Nichols!)
