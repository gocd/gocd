    # :call-seq:
    #   package(type, spec?) => task
    #
    # Defines and returns a package created by this project.
    #
    # The first argument declares the package type. For example, :jar to create a JAR file.
    # The package is an artifact that takes its artifact specification from the project.
    # You can override the artifact specification by passing various options in the second
    # argument, for example:
    #   package(:zip, :classifier=>'sources')
    #
    # Packages that are ZIP files provides various ways to include additional files, directories,
    # and even merge ZIPs together. Have a look at ZipTask for more information. In case you're
    # wondering, JAR and WAR packages are ZIP files.
    #
    # You can also enhance a JAR package using the ZipTask#with method that accepts the following options:
    # * :manifest -- Specifies how to create the MANIFEST.MF. By default, uses the project's
    #   #manifest property.
    # * :meta_inf -- Specifies files to be included in the META-INF directory. By default,
    #   uses the project's #meta-inf property.
    #
    # The WAR package supports the same options and adds a few more:
    # * :classes -- Directories of class files to include in WEB-INF/classes. Includes the compile
    #   target directory by default.
    # * :libs -- Artifacts and files to include in WEB-INF/libs. Includes the compile classpath
    #   dependencies by default.
    #
    # For example:
    #   define 'project' do
    #     define 'beans' do
    #       package :jar
    #     end
    #     define 'webapp' do
    #       compile.with project('beans')
    #       package(:war).with :libs=>MYSQL_JDBC
    #     end
    #     package(:zip, :classifier=>'sources').include path_to('.')
    #  end
    #
    # Two other packaging types are:
    # * package :sources -- Creates a JAR file with the source code and classifier 'sources', for use by IDEs.
    # * package :javadoc -- Creates a ZIP file with the Javadocs and classifier 'javadoc'. You can use the
    #   javadoc method to further customize it.
    #
    # A package is also an artifact. The following tasks operate on packages created by the project:
    #   buildr upload     # Upload packages created by the project
    #   buildr install    # Install packages created by the project
    #   buildr package    # Create packages
    #   buildr uninstall  # Remove previously installed packages
    #
    # If you want to add additional packaging types, implement a method with the name package_as_[type]
    # that accepts a file name and returns an appropriate Rake task.  For example:
    #   def package_as_zip(file_name) #:nodoc:
    #     ZipTask.define_task(file_name)
    #   end
    #
    # The file name is determined from the specification passed to the package method, however, some
    # packagers need to override this.  For example, package(:sources) produces a file with the extension
    # 'jar' and the classifier 'sources'.  If you need to overwrite the default implementation, you should
    # also include a method named package_as_[type]_spec.  For example:
    #   def package_as_sources_spec(spec) #:nodoc:
    #     # Change the source distribution to .zip extension
    #     spec.merge({ :type=>:zip, :classifier=>'sources' })
    #   end
    def package(*args)
      spec = Hash === args.last ? args.pop.dup : {}
      no_options = spec.empty? # since spec is mutated
      if spec[:file]
        rake_check_options spec, :file, :type
