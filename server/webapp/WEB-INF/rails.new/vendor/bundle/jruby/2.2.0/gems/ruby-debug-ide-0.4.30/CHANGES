========================================================================

0.1.9 - 0.1.10
--------------

  * fixed bug when inspected variable's to_s methods returns non-String.
    Returns diagonstic message now.
  * do not use '==' from within debugger to prevent runtime error
  * Workarounding JRuby issue (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2063)
  * switching to ruby-debug-base 0.1.10 (all tests pass)

0.1.8 - 0.1.9
-------------

  * be sure 'exit' is always called.
  * to_inspect = str.gsub(/\\n/, "\n") in debug_eval() to make possible to
    evaluate multiline expressions. Frontend must escape new lines
    accordingly.
  * prevent exception when to_s returns nil on being evaluated value

0.1.7 - 0.1.8
-------------

  * fixed error during breakpoint removing
  * (protocols merge) print debug message on $stderr like classic debugger

0.1.6 - 0.1.7
-------------

  * ensure 'yaml' (is_binary_data?) is always loaded in xml_printer.rb
  * VarInstanceCommand enumerates also variables of an object's class, as it
    is done in the classic-debugger
  * do not send unneeded end-of-lines (fast and classic protocol merging)
  * do not send non-xml PROMPT and CONFIRM + getting rid of 'confirm' methods
    in the whole codebase (fast and classic protocol merging)
  * send info <message> when 'delete' is used without given 'pos' (deleting of
    all breakpoints is not supported)
  * return <error> on 'delete <negative_int>' (protocol unification)
  * always use one-based frame numbering (was not the case in <frame[s]>)
  * send message 'finished' back when exiting

0.1.5 - 0.1.6
-------------

  * do not send binary data within values of variables. See
    http://www.netbeans.org/nonav/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=101748 for more
    details

0.1.4 - 0.1.5
-------------

  * fixed subtle bug in xml_printer.rb#print_variable which caused the
    debugger to die when == method was overridden and did not count on nil
    parameters
  * Hash and Array subclasses did not have children thus cannot be expanded in
    a GUI. E.g. @params in Rails controller (HashWithIndifferentAccess)

0.1.3 - 0.1.4
-------------

  * migration to ruby-debug 0.1.4

0.1.2 - 0.1.3
-------------

  * adding step+ and next+ commands (since ruby-debug 0.9.1)
