= Rake 0.9.4 Released

Rake version 0.9.4 contains a number of bug fixes.

== Changes

=== Bug Fixes (0.9.4)

* Exit status with failing tests is not correctly set to non-zero.

* Simplified syntax for phony task (for older versions of RDoc).

* Stand alone FileList usage gets glob function (without loading in
  extra dependencies)

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://github.com/jimweirich/rake
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50
GitHub::    git://github.com/jimweirich/rake.git
