module ActionController
  # This module provides a method which will redirect browser to use HTTPS
  # protocol. This will ensure that user's sensitive information will be
  # transferred safely over the internet. You _should_ always force browser
  # to use HTTPS when you're transferring sensitive information such as
  # user authentication, account information, or credit card information.
  #
  # Note that if you are really concerned about your application security,
  # you might consider using +config.force_ssl+ in your config file instead.
  # That will ensure all the data transferred via HTTPS protocol and prevent
  # user from getting session hijacked when accessing the site under unsecured
  # HTTP protocol.
