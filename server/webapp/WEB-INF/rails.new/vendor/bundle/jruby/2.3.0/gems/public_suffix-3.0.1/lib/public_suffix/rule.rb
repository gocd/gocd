module PublicSuffix

  # A Rule is a special object which holds a single definition
  # of the Public Suffix List.
  #
  # There are 3 types of rules, each one represented by a specific
  # subclass within the +PublicSuffix::Rule+ namespace.
  #
  # To create a new Rule, use the {PublicSuffix::Rule#factory} method.
  #
  #   PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("ar")
  #   # => #<PublicSuffix::Rule::Normal>
  #
  module Rule

    # @api internal
    Entry = Struct.new(:type, :length, :private)

    # = Abstract rule class
    #
    # This represent the base class for a Rule definition
    # in the {Public Suffix List}[https://publicsuffix.org].
    #
    # This is intended to be an Abstract class
    # and you shouldn't create a direct instance. The only purpose
    # of this class is to expose a common interface
    # for all the available subclasses.
    #
    # * {PublicSuffix::Rule::Normal}
    # * {PublicSuffix::Rule::Exception}
    # * {PublicSuffix::Rule::Wildcard}
    #
    # ## Properties
    #
    # A rule is composed by 4 properties:
    #
    # value   - A normalized version of the rule name.
    #           The normalization process depends on rule tpe.
    #
    # Here's an example
    #
    #   PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("*.google.com")
    #   #<PublicSuffix::Rule::Wildcard:0x1015c14b0
    #       @value="google.com"
    #   >
    #
    # ## Rule Creation
    #
    # The best way to create a new rule is passing the rule name
    # to the <tt>PublicSuffix::Rule.factory</tt> method.
    #
    #   PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("com")
    #   # => PublicSuffix::Rule::Normal
    #
    #   PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("*.com")
    #   # => PublicSuffix::Rule::Wildcard
    #
    # This method will detect the rule type and create an instance
    # from the proper rule class.
    #
    # ## Rule Usage
    #
    # A rule describes the composition of a domain name and explains how to tokenize
    # the name into tld, sld and trd.
    #
    # To use a rule, you first need to be sure the name you want to tokenize
    # can be handled by the current rule.
    # You can use the <tt>#match?</tt> method.
    #
    #   rule = PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("com")
    #
    #   rule.match?("google.com")
    #   # => true
    #
    #   rule.match?("google.com")
    #   # => false
    #
    # Rule order is significant. A name can match more than one rule.
    # See the {Public Suffix Documentation}[http://publicsuffix.org/format/]
    # to learn more about rule priority.
    #
    # When you have the right rule, you can use it to tokenize the domain name.
    #
    #   rule = PublicSuffix::Rule.factory("com")
    #
    #   rule.decompose("google.com")
    #   # => ["google", "com"]
    #
    #   rule.decompose("www.google.com")
    #   # => ["www.google", "com"]

      #
      # A domain name is said to match a rule if and only if
      # all of the following conditions are met:
      #
      # - When the domain and rule are split into corresponding labels,
      #   that the domain contains as many or more labels than the rule.
      # - Beginning with the right-most labels of both the domain and the rule,
      #   and continuing for all labels in the rule, one finds that for every pair,
      #   either they are identical, or that the label from the rule is "*".
