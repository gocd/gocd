      # when file was changed and when the event was triggered.
      #
      # If a file is saved at ???14.998, by the time the event is
      # actually received by Listen, the time could already be e.g.
      # ???15.7.
      #
      # And since Darwin adapter uses directory scanning, the file
      # mtime may be the same (e.g. file was changed at ???14.001,
      # then at ???14.998, but the fstat time would be ???14.0 in
      # both cases).
      #
      # If change happend at ???14.999997, the mtime is 14.0, so for
      # an mtime=???14.0 we assume it could even be almost ???15.0
      #
      # So if Time.now.to_f is ???15.999998 and stat reports mtime
      # at ???14.0, then event was due to that file'd change when:
      #
      # ???15.999997 - ???14.999998 < 1.0s
      #
      # So the "2" is "1 + 1" (1s to cover rb-fsevent latency +
      # 1s maximum difference between real mtime and that recorded
      # in the file system)
