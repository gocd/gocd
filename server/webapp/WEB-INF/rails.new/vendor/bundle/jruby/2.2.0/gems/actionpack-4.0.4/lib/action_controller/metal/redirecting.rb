    # Redirects the browser to the target specified in +options+. This parameter can take one of three forms:
    #
    # * <tt>Hash</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+.
    # * <tt>Record</tt> - The URL will be generated by calling url_for with the +options+, which will reference a named URL for that record.
    # * <tt>String</tt> starting with <tt>protocol://</tt> (like <tt>http://</tt>) or a protocol relative reference (like <tt>//</tt>) - Is passed straight through as the target for redirection.
    # * <tt>String</tt> not containing a protocol - The current protocol and host is prepended to the string.
    # * <tt>Proc</tt> - A block that will be executed in the controller's context. Should return any option accepted by +redirect_to+.
    # * <tt>:back</tt> - Back to the page that issued the request. Useful for forms that are triggered from multiple places.
    #   Short-hand for <tt>redirect_to(request.env["HTTP_REFERER"])</tt>

    # integer, or a symbol representing the downcased, underscored and symbolized description.
    # Note that the status code must be a 3xx HTTP code, or redirection will not occur.
    #
    # If you are using XHR requests other than GET or POST and redirecting after the
    # request then some browsers will follow the redirect using the original request
    # method. This may lead to undesirable behavior such as a double DELETE. To work
    # around this  you can return a <tt>303 See Other</tt> status code which will be
    # followed using a GET request.

    # It is also possible to assign a flash message as part of the redirection. There are two special accessors for the commonly used flash names
    # +alert+ and +notice+ as well as a general purpose +flash+ bucket.
    #
    #   redirect_to post_url(@post), alert: "Watch it, mister!"

    #   redirect_to({ action: 'atom' }, alert: "Something serious happened")
    #
    # When using <tt>redirect_to :back</tt>, if there is no referrer, ActionController::RedirectBackError will be raised. You may specify some fallback
    # behavior for this case by rescuing ActionController::RedirectBackError.
