# map_mixin to patch LinkedHashMap and HashMap. it must be done directly on the classes,
# using a module mixin does not work, and injecting in the Map interface does not work either
# but injecting in the class works.
# see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/1249

# this is a temporary fix to solve a bug in JRuby where classes implementing the Map interface, like LinkedHashMap
# have a bug in the has_key? method that is implemented in the Enumerable module that is somehow mixed in the Map interface.
# this bug makes has_key? (and all its aliases) return false for a key that has a nil value.
# Only LinkedHashMap is patched here because patching the Map interface is not working.
# TODO find proper fix, and submit upstream
# releavant JRuby files:
# https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/core/src/main/ruby/jruby/java/java_ext/java.util.rb
# https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/jruby/java/proxies/MapJavaProxy.java
