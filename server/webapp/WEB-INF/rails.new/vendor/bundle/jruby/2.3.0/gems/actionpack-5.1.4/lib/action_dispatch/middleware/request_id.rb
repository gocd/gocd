module ActionDispatch
  # Makes a unique request id available to the +action_dispatch.request_id+ env variable (which is then accessible
  # through <tt>ActionDispatch::Request#request_id</tt> or the alias <tt>ActionDispatch::Request#uuid</tt>) and sends
  # the same id to the client via the X-Request-Id header.
  #
  # The unique request id is either based on the X-Request-Id header in the request, which would typically be generated
  # by a firewall, load balancer, or the web server, or, if this header is not available, a random uuid. If the
  # header is accepted from the outside world, we sanitize it to a max of 255 chars and alphanumeric and dashes only.
  #
  # The unique request id can be used to trace a request end-to-end and would typically end up being part of log files
  # from multiple pieces of the stack.
