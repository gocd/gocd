# Changelog


#### Release 3.0.1

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.
- CHANGED: Improve performance and avoid allocation (GH-146). [Thanks @robholland]


#### Release 3.0.0

This new version includes a major redesign of the library internals, with the goal to drastically
improve the lookup time while reducing storage space.

For this reason, several public methods that are no longer applicable have been deprecated
and/or removed. You can find more information at GH-133.

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.
- CHANGED: Dropped support for Ruby < 2.1
- CHANGED: `PublicSuffix::List#rules` is now protected. You should not rely on it as the internal rule representation is subject to change to optimize performances.
- CHANGED: Removed `PublicSuffix::List.clear`, it was an unnecessary accessor method. Use `PublicSuffix::List.default = nil` if you **really** need to reset the default list. You shouldn't.
- CHANGED: `PublicSuffix::List#select` is now private. You should not use it, instead use `PublicSuffix::List#find`.
- CHANGED: `PublicSuffix::List` no longer implements Enumerable. Instead, use `#each` to loop over, or get an Enumerator.
- CHANGED: Redesigned internal list storage and lookup algorithm to achieve O(1) lookup time (see GH-133).


#### Release 2.0.5

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.
- CHANGED: Initialization performance improvements (GH-128). [Thanks @casperisfine]


#### Release 2.0.4

- FIXED: Fix a bug that caused the GEM to be published with the wrong version number in the gemspec (GH-121).

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.


#### Release 2.0.3

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.


#### Release 2.0.2

- CHANGED: Updated definitions.


#### Release 2.0.1

- FIXED: Fix bug that prevented .valid? to reset the default rule


#### Release 2.0.0

- NEW: Added PublicSuffix.domain # => sld.tld
- NEW: Added the ability to disable the use of private domains either at runtime, in addition to the ability to not load the private domains section when reading the list (`private_domains: false`). This feature also superseded the `private_domains` class-level attribute, that is no longer available.

- CHANGED: Considerable performance improvements (GH-92)
- CHANGED: Updated definitions.
- CHANGED: Removed deprecated PublicSuffix::InvalidDomain exception
- CHANGED: If the suffix is now listed, then the prevaling rule is "*" as defined by the PSL algorithm (GH-91)
- CHANGED: Input validation is performed only if you call `PublicSuffix.parse` or `PublicSuffix.list`
- CHANGED: Input with leading dot is invalid per PSL acceptance tests
- CHANGED: Removed `private_domains` class-level attribute. It is replaced by the `private_domains: false` option in the list parse method.
- CHANGED: The default list now assumes you use UTF-8 for reading the input (GH-94),

- REMOVED: Removed futile utility helpers such as `Domain#rule`, `Domain#is_a_domain?`, `Domain#is_a_subdomain?`, `Domain#valid?`. You can easily obtain the same result by having a custom method that reconstructs the logic, and/or calling `PublicSuffix.{domain|parse}(domain.to_s)`.
