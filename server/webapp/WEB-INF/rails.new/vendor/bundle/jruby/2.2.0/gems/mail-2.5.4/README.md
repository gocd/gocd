Mail [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikel/mail.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikel/mail)
====

Introduction
------------

Mail is an internet library for Ruby that is designed to handle emails
generation, parsing and sending in a simple, rubyesque manner.

The purpose of this library is to provide a single point of access to handle
all email functions, including sending and receiving emails.  All network
type actions are done through proxy methods to Net::SMTP, Net::POP3 etc.

Built from my experience with TMail, it is designed to be a pure ruby
implementation that makes generating, sending and parsing emails a no
brainer.

It is also designed form the ground up to work with Ruby 1.9.  This is because
Ruby 1.9 handles text encodings much more magically than Ruby 1.8.x and so
these features have been taken full advantage of in this library allowing
Mail to handle a lot more messages more cleanly than TMail.  Mail does run on
Ruby 1.8.x... it's just not as fun to code.

Finally, Mail has been designed with a very simple object oriented system
that really opens up the email messages you are parsing, if you know what
you are doing, you can fiddle with every last bit of your email directly.

Donations
-------------

Mail has been downloaded millions of times, by people around the world, in fact,
it represents more than 1% of *all* gems downloaded.

It is (like all open source software) a labour of love and something I am doing
with my own free time.  If you would like to say thanks, please feel free to
[make a donation](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/8790) and feel free to send
me a nice email :)

Current Capabilities of Mail
----------------------------

* RFC2822 Support, Reading and Writing
* RFC2045-2049 Support for multipart emails
* Support for creating multipart alternate emails
* Support for reading multipart/report emails &amp; getting details from such
* Support for multibyte emails - needs quite a lot of work and testing
* Wrappers for File, Net/POP3, Net/SMTP
* Auto encoding of non US-ASCII header fields
* Auto encoding of non US-ASCII bodies

Mail is RFC2822 compliant now, that is, it can parse and generate valid US-ASCII
emails.  There are a few obsoleted syntax emails that it will have problems with, but
it also is quite robust, meaning, if it finds something it doesn't understand it will
not crash, instead, it will skip the problem and keep parsing.  In the case of a header
it doesn't understand, it will initialise the header as an optional unstructured
field and continue parsing.

This means Mail won't (ever) crunch your data (I think).

You can also create MIME emails.  There are helper methods for making a
multipart/alternate email for text/plain and text/html (the most common pair)
and you can manually create any other type of MIME email.

Roadmap
-------

Next TODO:

* Improve MIME support for character sets in headers, currently works, mostly, needs
  refinement.

Testing Policy
--------------

Basically... we do BDD on Mail.  No method gets written in Mail without a
corresponding or covering spec.  We expect as a minimum 100% coverage
measured by RCov.  While this is not perfect by any measure, it is pretty
good.  Additionally, all functional tests from TMail are to be passing before
the gem gets released.

It also means you can be sure Mail will behave correctly.

API Policy
----------

No API removals within a single point release.  All removals to be deprecated with
warnings for at least one MINOR point release before removal.

Also, all private or protected methods to be declared as such - though this is still I/P.

Installation
------------

Installation is fairly simple, I host mail on rubygems, so you can just do:

    # gem install mail

Encodings
---------

If you didn't know, handling encodings in Emails is not as straight forward as you
would hope.

I have tried to simplify it some:

1. All objects that can render into an email, have an `#encoded` method.  Encoded will
   return the object as a complete string ready to send in the mail system, that is,
   it will include the header field and value and CRLF at the end and wrapped as
   needed.

2. All objects that can render into an email, have a `#decoded` method.  Decoded will
   return the object's "value" only as a string.  This means it will not include
   the header fields (like 'To:' or 'Subject:').

3. By default, calling <code>#to_s</code> on a container object will call its encoded
   method, while <code>#to_s</code> on a field object will call its decoded method.
   So calling <code>#to_s</code> on a Mail object will return the mail, all encoded
   ready to send, while calling <code>#to_s</code> on the From field or the body will
   return the decoded value of the object. The header object of Mail is considered a
   container. If you are in doubt, call <code>#encoded</code>, or <code>#decoded</code>
   explicitly, this is safer if you are not sure.

4. Structured fields that have parameter values that can be encoded (e.g. Content-Type) will
   provide decoded parameter values when you call the parameter names as methods against
   the object.

5. Structured fields that have parameter values that can be encoded (e.g. Content-Type) will
   provide encoded parameter values when you call the parameter names through the
   <code>object.parameters['<parameter_name>']</code> method call.

Contributing
------------

Please do!  Contributing is easy in Mail.  Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md document for more info

Usage
-----

All major mail functions should be able to happen from the Mail module.
So, you should be able to just <code>require 'mail'</code> to get started.

### Making an email

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  from    'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
  to      'you@test.lindsaar.net'
  subject 'This is a test email'
  body    File.read('body.txt')
end

mail.to_s #=> "From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\nTo: you@...
```

### Making an email, have it your way:

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  body File.read('body.txt')
end

mail['from'] = 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
mail[:to]    = 'you@test.lindsaar.net'
mail.subject = 'This is a test email'

mail.to_s #=> "From: mikel@test.lindsaar.net\r\nTo: you@...
```

### Don't Worry About Message IDs:

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  to   'you@test.lindsaar.net'
  body 'Some simple body'
end

mail.to_s =~ /Message\-ID: <[\d\w_]+@.+.mail/ #=> 27
```

Mail will automatically add a Message-ID field if it is missing and
give it a unique, random Message-ID along the lines of:

    <4a7ff76d7016_13a81ab802e1@local.host.mail>

### Or do worry about Message-IDs:

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  to         'you@test.lindsaar.net'
  message_id '<ThisIsMyMessageId@some.domain.com>'
  body       'Some simple body'
end

mail.to_s =~ /Message\-ID: <ThisIsMyMessageId@some.domain.com>/ #=> 27
```

Mail will take the message_id you assign to it trusting that you know
what you are doing.

### Sending an email:

Mail defaults to sending via SMTP to local host port 25.  If you have a
sendmail or postfix daemon running on on this port, sending email is as
easy as:

```ruby
Mail.deliver do
   from    'me@test.lindsaar.net'
   to      'you@test.lindsaar.net'
   subject 'Here is the image you wanted'
   body    File.read('body.txt')
  add_file '/full/path/to/somefile.png'
end
```

or

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  from     'me@test.lindsaar.net'
  to       'you@test.lindsaar.net'
  subject  'Here is the image you wanted'
  body     File.read('body.txt')
  add_file :filename => 'somefile.png', :content => File.read('/somefile.png')
end

mail.deliver!
```

Sending via sendmail can be done like so:

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  from     'me@test.lindsaar.net'
  to       'you@test.lindsaar.net'
  subject  'Here is the image you wanted'
  body     File.read('body.txt')
  add_file :filename => 'somefile.png', :content => File.read('/somefile.png')
end

mail.delivery_method :sendmail

mail.deliver
```

Exim requires its own delivery manager, and can be used like so:

```ruby
mail.delivery_method :exim, :location => "/usr/bin/exim"

mail.deliver
```

### Getting emails from a pop server:

You can configure Mail to receive email using <code>retriever_method</code>
within <code>Mail.defaults</code>:

```ruby
Mail.defaults do
  retriever_method :pop3, :address    => "pop.gmail.com",
                          :port       => 995,
                          :user_name  => '<username>',
                          :password   => '<password>',
                          :enable_ssl => true
end
```

You can access incoming email in a number of ways.

The most recent email:

```ruby
Mail.all    #=> Returns an array of all emails
Mail.first  #=> Returns the first unread email
Mail.last   #=> Returns the last unread email
```

The first 10 emails sorted by date in ascending order:

```ruby
emails = Mail.find(:what => :first, :count => 10, :order => :asc)
emails.length #=> 10
```

Or even all emails:

```ruby
emails = Mail.all
emails.length #=> LOTS!
```


### Reading an Email

```ruby
mail = Mail.read('/path/to/message.eml')

mail.envelope.from   #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
mail.from.addresses  #=> ['mikel@test.lindsaar.net', 'ada@test.lindsaar.net']
mail.sender.address  #=> 'mikel@test.lindsaar.net'
mail.to              #=> 'bob@test.lindsaar.net'
mail.cc              #=> 'sam@test.lindsaar.net'
mail.subject         #=> "This is the subject"
mail.date.to_s       #=> '21 Nov 1997 09:55:06 -0600'
mail.message_id      #=> '<4D6AA7EB.6490534@xxx.xxx>'
mail.body.decoded    #=> 'This is the body of the email...
```

Many more methods available.

### Reading a Multipart Email

```ruby
mail = Mail.read('multipart_email')

mail.multipart?          #=> true
mail.parts.length        #=> 2
mail.body.preamble       #=> "Text before the first part"
mail.body.epilogue       #=> "Text after the last part"
mail.parts.map { |p| p.content_type }  #=> ['text/plain', 'application/pdf']
mail.parts.map { |p| p.class }         #=> [Mail::Message, Mail::Message]
mail.parts[0].content_type_parameters  #=> {'charset' => 'ISO-8859-1'}
mail.parts[1].content_type_parameters  #=> {'name' => 'my.pdf'}
```

Mail generates a tree of parts.  Each message has many or no parts.  Each part
is another message which can have many or no parts.

A message will only have parts if it is a multipart/mixed or related/mixed
content type and has a boundary defined.

### Testing and extracting attachments
```ruby
mail.attachments.each do | attachment |
  # Attachments is an AttachmentsList object containing a
  # number of Part objects
  if (attachment.content_type.start_with?('image/'))
    # extracting images for example...
    filename = attachment.filename
    begin
      File.open(images_dir + filename, "w+b", 0644) {|f| f.write attachment.body.decoded}
    rescue Exception => e
      puts "Unable to save data for #{filename} because #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
```
### Writing and sending a multipart/alternative (html and text) email

Mail makes some basic assumptions and makes doing the common thing as
simple as possible.... (asking a lot from a mail library)

```ruby
mail = Mail.deliver do
  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'
  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'
  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'

  text_part do
    body 'This is plain text'
  end

  html_part do
    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    body '<h1>This is HTML</h1>'
  end
end
```

Mail then delivers the email at the end of the block and returns the
resulting Mail::Message object, which you can then inspect if you
so desire...

```
puts mail.to_s #=>

To: nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au
From: Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>
Subject: First multipart email sent with Mail
Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
  boundary=--==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659
Message-ID: <4a914f12ac7e_6f0f1ab80267d1@baci.local.mail>
Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659
Content-ID: <4a914f12c8c4_6f0f1ab80268d6@baci.local.mail>
Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This is plain text
----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-ID: <4a914f12cf86_6f0f1ab802692c@baci.local.mail>
Date: Mon, 24 Aug 2009 00:15:46 +1000
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

<h1>This is HTML</h1>
----==_mimepart_4a914f0c911be_6f0f1ab8026659--
```

Mail inserts the content transfer encoding, the mime version,
the content-id's and handles the content-type and boundary.

Mail assumes that if your text in the body is only us-ascii, that your
transfer encoding is 7bit and it is text/plain.  You can override this
by explicitly declaring it.

### Making Multipart/Alternate, without a block

You don't have to use a block with the text and html part included, you
can just do it declaratively.  However, you need to add Mail::Parts to
an email, not Mail::Messages.

```ruby
mail = Mail.new do
  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'
  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'
  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'
end

text_part = Mail::Part.new do
  body 'This is plain text'
end

html_part = Mail::Part.new do
  content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
  body '<h1>This is HTML</h1>'
end

mail.text_part = text_part
mail.html_part = html_part
```

Results in the same email as done using the block form

### Getting error reports from an email:

```ruby
@mail = Mail.read('/path/to/bounce_message.eml')

@mail.bounced?         #=> true
@mail.final_recipient  #=> rfc822;mikel@dont.exist.com
@mail.action           #=> failed
@mail.error_status     #=> 5.5.0
@mail.diagnostic_code  #=> smtp;550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable
@mail.retryable?       #=> false
```

### Attaching and Detaching Files

You can just read the file off an absolute path, Mail will try
to guess the mime_type and will encode the file in Base64 for you.

```ruby
@mail = Mail.new
@mail.add_file("/path/to/file.jpg")
@mail.parts.first.attachment? #=> true
@mail.parts.first.content_transfer_encoding.to_s #=> 'base64'
@mail.attachments.first.mime_type #=> 'image/jpg'
@mail.attachments.first.filename #=> 'file.jpg'
@mail.attachments.first.decoded == File.read('/path/to/file.jpg') #=> true
```

Or You can pass in file_data and give it a filename, again, mail
will try and guess the mime_type for you.

```ruby
@mail = Mail.new
@mail.attachments['myfile.pdf'] = File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf')
@mail.parts.first.attachment? #=> true
@mail.attachments.first.mime_type #=> 'application/pdf'
@mail.attachments.first.decoded == File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf') #=> true
```

You can also override the guessed MIME media type if you really know better
than mail (this should be rarely needed)

```ruby
@mail = Mail.new
file_data = File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf')
@mail.attachments['myfile.pdf'] = { :mime_type => 'application/x-pdf',
                                    :content => File.read('path/to/myfile.pdf') }
@mail.parts.first.mime_type #=> 'application/x-pdf'
```

Of course... Mail will round trip an attachment as well

```ruby
@mail = Mail.new do
  to      'nicolas@test.lindsaar.net.au'
  from    'Mikel Lindsaar <mikel@test.lindsaar.net.au>'
  subject 'First multipart email sent with Mail'

  text_part do
    body 'Here is the attachment you wanted'
  end

  html_part do
    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    body '<h1>Funky Title</h1><p>Here is the attachment you wanted</p>'
  end

  add_file '/path/to/myfile.pdf'
end

@round_tripped_mail = Mail.new(@mail.encoded)

@round_tripped_mail.attachments.length #=> 1
@round_tripped_mail.attachments.first.filename #=> 'myfile.pdf'
```
See "Testing and extracting attachments" above for more details.

Using Mail with Testing or Spec'ing Libraries
---------------------------------------------

If mail is part of your system, you'll need a way to test it without actually
sending emails, the TestMailer can do this for you.

```
require 'mail'
=> true
Mail.defaults do
  delivery_method :test
end
=> #<Mail::Configuration:0x19345a8 @delivery_method=Mail::TestMailer>
Mail::TestMailer.deliveries
=> []
Mail.deliver do
  to 'mikel@me.com'
  from 'you@you.com'
  subject 'testing'
  body 'hello'
end
=> #<Mail::Message:0x19284ec ...
Mail::TestMailer.deliveries.length
=> 1
Mail::TestMailer.deliveries.first
=> #<Mail::Message:0x19284ec ...
Mail::TestMailer.deliveries.clear
=> []
```

There is also a set of RSpec matchers stolen fr^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H inspired by Shoulda's ActionMailer matchers (you'll want to set <code>delivery_method</code> as above too):

```
Mail.defaults do
  delivery_method :test # in practice you'd do this in spec_helper.rb
end

describe "sending an email" do
  include Mail::Matchers

  before(:each) do
    Mail::TestMailer.deliveries.clear

    Mail.deliver do
      to ['mikel@me.com', 'mike2@me.com']
      from 'you@you.com'
      subject 'testing'
      body 'hello'
    end
  end

  it { should have_sent_email } # passes if any email at all was sent

  it { should have_sent_email.from('you@you.com') }
  it { should have_sent_email.to('mike1@me.com') }

  # can specify a list of recipients...
  it { should have_sent_email.to(['mike1@me.com', 'mike2@me.com']) }

  # ...or chain recipients together
  it { should have_sent_email.to('mike1@me.com').to('mike2@me.com') }

  it { should have_sent_email.with_subject('testing') }

  it { should have_sent_email.with_body('hello') }

  # Can match subject or body with a regex
  # (or anything that responds_to? :match)

  it { should have_sent_email.matching_subject(/test(ing)?/) }
  it { should have_sent_email.matching_body(/h(a|e)llo/) }

  # Can chain together modifiers
  # Note that apart from recipients, repeating a modifier overwrites old value.

  it { should have_sent_email.from('you@you.com').to('mike1@me.com').matching_body(/hell/)
end
```
