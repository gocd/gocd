bundle-package(1) -- Package your needed `.gem` files into your application
===========================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle package`

## DESCRIPTION

Copy all of the `.gem` files needed to run the application into the
`vendor/cache` directory. In the future, when running [bundle install(1)][bundle-install],
use the gems in the cache in preference to the ones on `rubygems.org`.

## GIT AND PATH GEMS

Since Bundler 1.2, the `bundle package` command can also package `:git` and
`:path` dependencies besides .gem files. This needs to be explicitly enabled
via the `--all` option. Once used, the `--all` option will be remembered.

## REMOTE FETCHING

By default, if you simply run [bundle install(1)][bundle-install] after running
[bundle package(1)][bundle-package], bundler will still connect to `rubygems.org`
to check whether a platform-specific gem exists for any of the gems
in `vendor/cache`.

For instance, consider this Gemfile(5):

    source "https://rubygems.org"

    gem "nokogiri"

If you run `bundle package` under C Ruby, bundler will retrieve
the version of `nokogiri` for the `"ruby"` platform. If you deploy
to JRuby and run `bundle install`, bundler is forced to check to
see whether a `"java"` platformed `nokogiri` exists.

Even though the `nokogiri` gem for the Ruby platform is
_technically_ acceptable on JRuby, it actually has a C extension
that does not run on JRuby. As a result, bundler will, by default,
still connect to `rubygems.org` to check whether it has a version
of one of your gems more specific to your platform.

This problem is also not just limited to the `"java"` platform.
A similar (common) problem can happen when developing on Windows
and deploying to Linux, or even when developing on OSX and
deploying to Linux.

If you know for sure that the gems packaged in `vendor/cache`
are appropriate for the platform you are on, you can run
`bundle install --local` to skip checking for more appropriate
gems, and just use the ones in `vendor/cache`.

One way to be sure that you have the right platformed versions
of all your gems is to run `bundle package` on an identical
machine and check in the gems. For instance, you can run
`bundle package` on an identical staging box during your
staging process, and check in the `vendor/cache` before
deploying to production.
