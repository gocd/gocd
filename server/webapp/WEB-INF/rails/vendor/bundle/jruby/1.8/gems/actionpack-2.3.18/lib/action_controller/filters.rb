    # Filters enable controllers to run shared pre- and post-processing code for its actions. These filters can be used to do
    # authentication, caching, or auditing before the intended action is performed. Or to do localization or output
    # compression after the action has been performed. Filters have access to the request, response, and all the instance
    # variables set by other filters in the chain or by the action (in the case of after filters).
    #
    # == Filter inheritance
    #
    # Controller inheritance hierarchies share filters downwards, but subclasses can also add or skip filters without
    # affecting the superclass. For example:
    #
    #   class BankController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter :audit
    #
    #     private
    #       def audit
    #         # record the action and parameters in an audit log
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    #   class VaultController < BankController
    #     before_filter :verify_credentials
    #
    #     private
    #       def verify_credentials
    #         # make sure the user is allowed into the vault
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    # Now any actions performed on the BankController will have the audit method called before. On the VaultController,
    # first the audit method is called, then the verify_credentials method. If the audit method renders or redirects, then
    # verify_credentials and the intended action are never called.
    #
    # == Filter types
    #
    # A filter can take one of three forms: method reference (symbol), external class, or inline method (proc). The first
    # is the most common and works by referencing a protected or private method somewhere in the inheritance hierarchy of
    # the controller by use of a symbol. In the bank example above, both BankController and VaultController use this form.
    #
    # Using an external class makes for more easily reused generic filters, such as output compression. External filter classes
    # are implemented by having a static +filter+ method on any class and then passing this class to the filter method. Example:
    #
    #   class OutputCompressionFilter
    #     def self.filter(controller)
    #       controller.response.body = compress(controller.response.body)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   class NewspaperController < ActionController::Base
    #     after_filter OutputCompressionFilter
    #   end
    #
    # The filter method is passed the controller instance and is hence granted access to all aspects of the controller and can
    # manipulate them as it sees fit.
    #
    # The inline method (using a proc) can be used to quickly do something small that doesn't require a lot of explanation.
    # Or just as a quick test. It works like this:
    #
    #   class WeblogController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter { |controller| head(400) if controller.params["stop_action"] }
    #   end
    #
    # As you can see, the block expects to be passed the controller after it has assigned the request to the internal variables.
    # This means that the block has access to both the request and response objects complete with convenience methods for params,
    # session, template, and assigns. Note: The inline method doesn't strictly have to be a block; any object that responds to call
    # and returns 1 or -1 on arity will do (such as a Proc or an Method object).
    #
    # Please note that around_filters function a little differently than the normal before and after filters with regard to filter
    # types. Please see the section dedicated to around_filters below.
    #
    # == Filter chain ordering
    #
    # Using <tt>before_filter</tt> and <tt>after_filter</tt> appends the specified filters to the existing chain. That's usually
    # just fine, but some times you care more about the order in which the filters are executed. When that's the case, you
    # can use <tt>prepend_before_filter</tt> and <tt>prepend_after_filter</tt>. Filters added by these methods will be put at the
    # beginning of their respective chain and executed before the rest. For example:
    #
    #   class ShoppingController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter :verify_open_shop
    #
    #   class CheckoutController < ShoppingController
    #     prepend_before_filter :ensure_items_in_cart, :ensure_items_in_stock
    #
    # The filter chain for the CheckoutController is now <tt>:ensure_items_in_cart, :ensure_items_in_stock,</tt>
    # <tt>:verify_open_shop</tt>. So if either of the ensure filters renders or redirects, we'll never get around to see if the shop
    # is open or not.
    #
    # You may pass multiple filter arguments of each type as well as a filter block.
    # If a block is given, it is treated as the last argument.
    #
    # == Around filters
    #
    # Around filters wrap an action, executing code both before and after.
    # They may be declared as method references, blocks, or objects responding
    # to +filter+ or to both +before+ and +after+.
    #
    # To use a method as an +around_filter+, pass a symbol naming the Ruby method.
    # Yield (or <tt>block.call</tt>) within the method to run the action.
    #
    #   around_filter :catch_exceptions
    #
    #   private
    #     def catch_exceptions
    #       yield
    #     rescue => exception
    #       logger.debug "Caught exception! #{exception}"
    #       raise
    #     end
    #
    # To use a block as an +around_filter+, pass a block taking as args both
    # the controller and the action block. You can't call yield directly from
    # an +around_filter+ block; explicitly call the action block instead:
    #
    #   around_filter do |controller, action|
    #     logger.debug "before #{controller.action_name}"
    #     action.call
    #     logger.debug "after #{controller.action_name}"
    #   end
    #
    # To use a filter object with +around_filter+, pass an object responding
    # to <tt>:filter</tt> or both <tt>:before</tt> and <tt>:after</tt>. With a
    # filter method, yield to the block as above:
    #
    #   around_filter BenchmarkingFilter
    #
    #   class BenchmarkingFilter
    #     def self.filter(controller, &block)
    #       Benchmark.measure(&block)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # With +before+ and +after+ methods:
    #
    #   around_filter Authorizer.new
    #
    #   class Authorizer
    #     # This will run before the action. Redirecting aborts the action.
    #     def before(controller)
    #       unless user.authorized?
    #         redirect_to(login_url)
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    #     # This will run after the action if and only if before did not render or redirect.
    #     def after(controller)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the filter has +before+ and +after+ methods, the +before+ method will be
    # called before the action. If +before+ renders or redirects, the filter chain is
    # halted and +after+ will not be run. See Filter Chain Halting below for
    # an example.
    #
    # == Filter chain skipping
    #
    # Declaring a filter on a base class conveniently applies to its subclasses,
    # but sometimes a subclass should skip some of its superclass' filters:
    #
    #   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    #     before_filter :authenticate
    #     around_filter :catch_exceptions
    #   end
    #
    #   class WeblogController < ApplicationController
    #     # Will run the :authenticate and :catch_exceptions filters.
    #   end
    #
    #   class SignupController < ApplicationController
    #     # Skip :authenticate, run :catch_exceptions.
    #     skip_before_filter :authenticate
    #   end
    #
    #   class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
    #     # Skip :catch_exceptions, run :authenticate.
    #     skip_filter :catch_exceptions
    #   end
    #
    #   class ClientsController < ApplicationController
    #     # Skip :catch_exceptions and :authenticate unless action is index.
    #     skip_filter :catch_exceptions, :authenticate, :except => :index
    #   end
    #
    # == Filter conditions
    #
    # Filters may be limited to specific actions by declaring the actions to
    # include or exclude. Both options accept single actions
    # (<tt>:only => :index</tt>) or arrays of actions
    # (<tt>:except => [:foo, :bar]</tt>).
    #
    #   class Journal < ActionController::Base
    #     # Require authentication for edit and delete.
    #     before_filter :authorize, :only => [:edit, :delete]
    #
    #     # Passing options to a filter with a block.
    #     around_filter(:except => :index) do |controller, action_block|
    #       results = Profiler.run(&action_block)
    #       controller.response.sub! "</body>", "#{results}</body>"
    #     end
    #
    #     private
    #       def authorize
    #         # Redirect to login unless authenticated.
    #       end
    #   end
    #
    # == Filter Chain Halting
    #
    # <tt>before_filter</tt> and <tt>around_filter</tt> may halt the request
    # before a controller action is run. This is useful, for example, to deny
    # access to unauthenticated users or to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
    # Simply call render or redirect. After filters will not be executed if the filter 
    # chain is halted.
    #
    # Around filters halt the request unless the action block is called.
    # Given these filters
    #   after_filter :after
    #   around_filter :around
    #   before_filter :before
    #
    # The filter chain will look like:
    #
    #   ...
    #   . \
    #   .  #around (code before yield)
    #   .  .  \
    #   .  .  #before (actual filter code is run)
    #   .  .  .  \
    #   .  .  .  execute controller action
    #   .  .  .  /
    #   .  .  ...
    #   .  .  /
    #   .  #around (code after yield)
    #   . /
    #   #after (actual filter code is run, unless the around filter does not yield)
    #
    # If +around+ returns before yielding, +after+ will still not be run. The +before+
    # filter and controller action will not be run. If +before+ renders or redirects,
    # the second half of +around+ and will still run but +after+ and the
    # action will not. If +around+ fails to yield, +after+ will not be run.
