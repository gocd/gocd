    Spring WebMVC 4.3.x does not appear to be affected by https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22060 based on review

    It is not believed that GoCD is directly vulnerable to the "SpringShell" attack since although we use WAR

    From review of https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22112 and the code of GoCD, GoCD does not appear to be
