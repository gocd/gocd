Description:
    The 'rails plugin new' command creates a skeleton for developing any
    kind of Rails extension with ability to run tests using dummy Rails
    application.

Example:
    rails plugin new ~/Code/Ruby/blog

    This generates a skeletal Rails plugin in ~/Code/Ruby/blog.
    See the README in the newly created plugin to get going.
