  body: Lookup a task, using scope and the scope hints in the task name. This method
    performs straight lookups without trying to synthesize file tasks or rules. Special
    scope names (e.g. '^') are recognized. If no scope argument is supplied, use the
    current scope. Return nil if the task cannot be found.
