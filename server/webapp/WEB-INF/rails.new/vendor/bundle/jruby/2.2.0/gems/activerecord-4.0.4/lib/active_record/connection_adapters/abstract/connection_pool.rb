  class ConnectionTimeoutError < ConnectionNotEstablished
  end

  module ConnectionAdapters
    # Connection pool base class for managing Active Record database
    # connections.
    #
    # == Introduction
    #
    # A connection pool synchronizes thread access to a limited number of
    # database connections. The basic idea is that each thread checks out a
    # database connection from the pool, uses that connection, and checks the
    # connection back in. ConnectionPool is completely thread-safe, and will
    # ensure that a connection cannot be used by two threads at the same time,
    # as long as ConnectionPool's contract is correctly followed. It will also
    # handle cases in which there are more threads than connections: if all
    # connections have been checked out, and a thread tries to checkout a
    # connection anyway, then ConnectionPool will wait until some other thread
    # has checked in a connection.
    #
    # == Obtaining (checking out) a connection
    #
    # Connections can be obtained and used from a connection pool in several
    # ways:
    #
    # 1. Simply use ActiveRecord::Base.connection as with Active Record 2.1 and
    #    earlier (pre-connection-pooling). Eventually, when you're done with
    #    the connection(s) and wish it to be returned to the pool, you call
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections!. This will be the
    #    default behavior for Active Record when used in conjunction with
    #    Action Pack's request handling cycle.
    # 2. Manually check out a connection from the pool with
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkout. You are responsible for
    #    returning this connection to the pool when finished by calling
    #    ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.checkin(connection).
    # 3. Use ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.with_connection(&block), which
    #    obtains a connection, yields it as the sole argument to the block,
    #    and returns it to the pool after the block completes.
    #
    # Connections in the pool are actually AbstractAdapter objects (or objects
    # compatible with AbstractAdapter's interface).
    #
    # == Options
    #
    # There are several connection-pooling-related options that you can add to
    # your database connection configuration:
    #
    # * +pool+: number indicating size of connection pool (default 5)
    # * +checkout_timeout+: number of seconds to block and wait for a connection
    #   before giving up and raising a timeout error (default 5 seconds).
    # * +reaping_frequency+: frequency in seconds to periodically run the
    #   Reaper, which attempts to find and close dead connections, which can
    #   occur if a programmer forgets to close a connection at the end of a
    #   thread or a thread dies unexpectedly. (Default nil, which means don't
    #   run the Reaper).
    # * +dead_connection_timeout+: number of seconds from last checkout
    #   after which the Reaper will consider a connection reapable. (default
    #   5 seconds).

      # with which it shares a Monitor.  But could be a generic Queue.
