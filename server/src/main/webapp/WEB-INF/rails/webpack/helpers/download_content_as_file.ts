 * Utility method to download arbitrary content as a named file. Most params are self-explanatory.

 * @param contents: The simplest `BlobPart[]` is any raw content (binary or text), but often just a
 *                  string array. For much of our usage, (e.g., from an AJAX response) this will
 *                  probably be a single string wrapped in an array.
 * @param name:     The desired filename for the download.
 * @param mimeType: An optional MIME type; defaults to plaintext.
