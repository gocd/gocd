## Description

Rack::Test is a small, simple testing API for Rack apps. It can be used on its
own or as a reusable starting point for Web frameworks and testing libraries
to build on.

## Features

* Maintains a cookie jar across requests
* Easily follow redirects when desired
* Set request headers to be used by all subsequent requests
* Small footprint. Approximately 200 LOC

## Supported platforms

* 2.2.2+
* 2.3
* 2.4
* JRuby 9.1.+

If you are using Ruby 1.8, 1.9 or JRuby 1.7, use rack-test 0.6.3.

## Examples
(The examples use `Test::Unit` but it's equally possible to use `rack-test` with other testing frameworks like `rspec`.)

```ruby
require "test/unit"
require "rack/test"

class HomepageTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  def app
    app = lambda { |env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ['All responses are OK']] }
    builder = Rack::Builder.new
    builder.run app
  end

  def test_response_is_ok
    get '/'

    assert last_response.ok?
    assert_equal last_response.body, 'All responses are OK'
  end

  def set_request_headers
    header 'Accept-Charset', 'utf-8'
    get '/'

    assert last_response.ok?
    assert_equal last_response.body, 'All responses are OK'
  end

  def test_response_is_ok_for_other_paths
    get '/other_paths'

    assert last_response.ok?
    assert_equal last_response.body, 'All responses are OK'
  end
  
  def post_with_json
    # No assertion in this, we just demonstrate how you can post a JSON-encoded string.
    # By default, Rack::Test will use HTTP form encoding if you pass in a Hash as the
    # parameters, so make sure that `json` below is already a JSON-serialized string.
    post(uri, json, { 'CONTENT_TYPE' => 'application/json' })
  end
end
```

If you want to test one app in isolation, you just return that app as shown above. But if you want to test the entire app stack, including middlewares, cascades etc. you need to parse the app defined in config.ru.

```ruby
OUTER_APP = Rack::Builder.parse_file("config.ru").first

class TestApp < Test::Unit::TestCase
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  def app
    OUTER_APP
  end

  def test_root
    get "/"
    assert last_response.ok?
  end
end
```
