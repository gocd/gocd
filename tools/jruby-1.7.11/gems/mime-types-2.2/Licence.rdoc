== Licence

This software is available under three licences: the GNU GPL version 2 (or at
your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic License, or the MIT License.
Note that my preference for licensing is the MIT License, but the original Perl
MIME::Types was dually originally licensed with the Perl Artistic Licence and
the GNU GPL ("the same terms as Perl itself") and given that the Ruby
implementation hewed pretty closely to the Perl version, I must maintain the
additional licensing terms.
