    # Looping through a collection of records from the database
    # (using the Scoping::Named::ClassMethods.all method, for example)
    # is very inefficient since it will try to instantiate all the objects at once.
    #
    # In that case, batch processing methods allow you to work
    # with the records in batches, thereby greatly reducing memory consumption.
    #
    # The #find_each method uses #find_in_batches with a batch size of 1000 (or as
    # specified by the +:batch_size+ option).
    #
    #   Person.find_each do |person|
    #     person.do_awesome_stuff
    #   end
    #
    #   Person.where("age > 21").find_each do |person|
    #     person.party_all_night!
    #   end
    #
    # If you do not provide a block to #find_each, it will return an Enumerator
    # for chaining with other methods:
    #

    #     person.award_trophy(index + 1)
    #   end
    #
    # ==== Options
    # * <tt>:batch_size</tt> - Specifies the size of the batch. Defaults to 1000.
    # * <tt>:start</tt> - Specifies the primary key value to start from, inclusive of the value.
    # * <tt>:finish</tt> - Specifies the primary key value to end at, inclusive of the value.
    # * <tt>:error_on_ignore</tt> - Overrides the application config to specify if an error should be raised when
    #   an order is present in the relation.
    #
    # Limits are honored, and if present there is no requirement for the batch
    # size: it can be less than, equal to, or greater than the limit.
    #
    # The options +start+ and +finish+ are especially useful if you want
    # multiple workers dealing with the same processing queue. You can make
    # worker 1 handle all the records between id 1 and 9999 and worker 2
    # handle from 10000 and beyond by setting the +:start+ and +:finish+
    # option on each worker.

    #   Person.find_each(start: 10_000) do |person|
    #     person.party_all_night!
    #   end
    #
    # NOTE: It's not possible to set the order. That is automatically set to
    # ascending on the primary key ("id ASC") to make the batch ordering
    # work. This also means that this method only works when the primary key is
    # orderable (e.g. an integer or string).
    #
    # NOTE: By its nature, batch processing is subject to race conditions if
    # other processes are modifying the database.
