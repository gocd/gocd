  * ExampleGroupProxy#backtrace (use #location instead)
  * ExampleProxy#backtrace (use #location instead)
  * BaseFormatter#example_pending now expects two arguments. The third
    argument is deprecated.
  * ExampleGroupProxy#filtered_description. This was only used in one place
    internally, and was a confusing solution to the problem. If you've got a
    custom formatter that uses it, you can just use
    ExampleGroupProxy#description and modify it directly.
  * predicate_matchers (use the new Matcher DSL instead)
  * Spec::Matchers.create (use Spec::Matchers.define instead)

* enhancements

  * support for specifying single examples with colon syntax. Closes #712.
    (Ben Mabey)
    * you can now say "spec some_spec.rb:12" in addition to "spec some_spec.rb

Bug-fix release (fixes regression introduced in 1.2.1)

* bug fixes

  * fixed bug in which spec_parser raised an error for custom example group
    base classes

=== Version 1.2.1 / 2009-03-22

This is a bug-fix release, recommended for anybody who has already upgraded to
rspec-1.2.0.

See Upgrade.rdoc for information about upgrading to rspec-1.2.1

* enhancements

  * matchers, including the new DSL, easily added to your test/unit tests
  * added support for 0 to n args in matcher DSL
  * restored loading rubygems when necessary
    * if you really don't want to use rubygems, you
      can set an NO_RUBYGEMS environment
      variable, and RSpec won't force it on you.
  * added -u/--debugger option (Rick DeNatale) #262.
    * just add "debugger" anywhere in your code and run spec path/to/code --debugger
  * rename ExampleDescription to ExampleProxy
  * pass ExampleProxy to example_started(). Closes #738, #743
    * thanks to Tobias Grimm (Eclipse) fort the patch and Roman Chernyatchik
      (JetBrains, RubyMine) for the assist

* bug fixes

  * subject (implicit or explicit) is now properly inherited by nested groups. Closes #744.

=== Version 1.2.0 / 2009-03-15

* warnings:

  * If you use the ruby command to run specs instead of the spec command, you'll
    need to require 'spec/autorun' or they won't run. This won't affect you if
    you use the spec command or the Spec::Rake::SpecTask that ships with RSpec.

  * require 'spec/test/unit' to invoke test/unit interop if you're using
    RSpec's core (this is handled implicitly with spec-rails)

  * setup and teardown are gone - use before and after instead

    * you can still use setup and teardown if you're using
      Test::Unit::TestCase as the base ExampleGroup class (which is implicit
      in rspec-rails)

  * The matcher protocol has been improved. The old protocol is still
    supported, so as long as you're not monkey patching rspec's built-in
    matchers, or using extension libraries that do, this should not affect
    you. If you run into trouble, you'll just need to change:

      failure_message          => failure_message_for_should
      negative_failure_message => failure_message_for_should_not

  * All references to rubygems have been removed from within rspec's code.

    * NOTE that they have been restored in 1.2.1, above

    * See http://gist.github.com/54177 for rationale and suggestions on
      alternative approaches to loading rubygems

* deprecations

  * BaseTextFormatter#colourize - use colorize_failure instead.
  * BaseTextFormatter#magenta - use red instead.

* enhancements

  * cleaner integration with with heckle-1.4.2
  * allow registering example groups with a path-like key (Pat Maddox)
  * start DRb service at "druby://localhost:0" (Hongli Lai) - See http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/496
  * consistent reporting of errors as failures
  * added spec/test/unit as more intuitive path to loading test/unit interop lib
  * added explicit autorun feature for running specs with ruby command
  * added handling for does_not_match? for matchers that want to know the context in which they were called
  * lots of ruby 1.9.1 compatibility fixes from Chad Humprhies
  * improved feedback from be_kind_of/be_a_kind_of/be_instance_of/be_an_instance_of (Jakub Šťastný)
  * added --format silent (l) option, which is now the default when running --heckle (Bob Aman)
  * sexy new custom matcher creation (Corey Haines & David Chelimsky - initial concept by Yehuda Katz)
  * improved matcher protocol - old one is still supported, but new one is cleaner and prefered

* bug fixes

  * support delegating operator matchers to subject with should_not
  * all arguments are included if --drb is specified in spec.opts (Neil Buckley). Closes #671.
  * added --autospec option hack (used internally) to get --color to work when using --drb and autospec.
  * Fixed mock framework failure message bug in which similar calls were excluded from the output
  * cryptic error message on change.rb when the from value is wrong (Michael Murray). Closes #706.

=== Version 1.1.12 / 2009-01-11

WARNING: there was a stub/mock bug in 1.1.11 that allowed a structure that was
not intended:

  obj.stub!(:msg)
  obj.msg
  obj.should_receive(:msg)

That would pass in 1.1.11, but should not have been allowed to, since the
message is received before the expectation is set. This was reported (#637)
and fixed for release 1.1.12, but may cause unexpected failures if you had
examples set up as above.

WARNING: mock.should_receive(:msg).with(an_instance_of(klass)) now correctly uses instance_of? instead of kind_of?. This may break some existing code examples, but the fix is to just use kind_of instead of an_instance_of

* 3 deprecations

  * deprecated ExampleMethods#implementation_backtrace - use ExampleMethods#backtrace instead
  * deprecated ExampleGroupMethods#example_group_backtrace - use ExampleGroupMethods#backtrace instead
  * deprecated Spec::Example::BehaviourRunner class (likely that nobody is using this)

* 6 major enhancements

  * it { should matcher } - support for implicit receiver of #should (Joe Ferris of thoughtbot)
  * subject { ... } - works in conjunction with implicit receiver of #should
  * wrap_expectation (for wrapping multiple expectations and/or t/u assertions)
  * added array.should =~ [1,2,3] # passes if array contains exactly the same elements in any order (Jeff Dean and Pat Maddox)
  * hash_including mock argument matcher can now accept just keys, key/value pairs, or both (David Krmpotic)
  * added hash_not_including mock argument matcher (David Krmpotic). Closes #634.

* 9 minor enhancements

  * should throw_symbol accepts an optional argument: should throw_symbol(:sym, arg)
  * fixed --line for jruby (Zach Moazeni)
  * assorted small changes to support Ruby 1.9 (got a way to go)
  * removed all instances of class << self - I do know who I am
  * SpecParser can't handle backtrace paths with colons (John-Mason P. Shackelford). Closes #505.
  * html formatter (and subsequently the textmate formatter) header fills in completely when running a single example
  * config.include now accepts an array of types (config.include(Helpers, :type => [:view, :controller]))
  * added be_a and be_an expectation matchers
  * added instance_of and kind_of mock argument matchers

* 9 bug fixes

  * fixed bug where {:a => 1, :b => 2}.should include(:a, :b) failed (Yossef Mendelssohn)
  * only try to load Test::Unit if Test::Unit is defined (not just Test)
  * Allow stubs on parent and child classes simultaneously (Jim Lindley). Fixes #600.
  * BaseTextFormatter will now create the directory in a WHERE string (Adam Anderson). Fixes #616.
  * Removed incorrect -S flag on autospec commands. Added explicit spec command for ruby to run, guarantee running rspec (raggi). Closes #507.
  * Check whether test/unit has really been loaded before calling a method it defines (Brian Donovan). Closes #503.
  * Fix spec_path for shared groups (Zach Dennis). Closes #615.
  * stubbed message expectation not verified if it has been called *before* the expectation (Matthias Hennemeyer). Closes #637.
  * stubs calculate return value by executing block passed to #and_return (hint from Aisha Fenton). Closes #642.

  * eliminate ALL gem dependencies (as they were causing trouble for people on different platforms/environments)

=== Version 1.1.10 / 2008-10-24

* 1 minor enhancement

  * hash.should include(:key => 'value') #when you don't care about the whole hash

* 2 bug fixes

  * fix --help output (had inaccurate info about 'nested' formatter)
  * eliminate spicycode-rcov dev dependency for rubygems < 1.3

=== Version 1.1.9 / 2008-10-20

WARNING: This release removes implicit inclusion of modules in example groups.
This means that if you have 'describe MyModule do', MyModule will not be
included in the group.

* 2 major enhancements

  * Add extend to configuration (thanks to advice from Chad Fowler)
  * Modules are no longer implicitly included in example groups

* 4 minor enhancements

  * fixed bug where rspec-autotest (autospec) was loading non-spec files in spec directory. Fixes #559.
  * fixed bug where should_not_receive was reporting twice
  * fixed bug where rspec tries to run examples just because it is required (even if there are no examples loaded). Fixes #575.

=== Version 1.1.8 / 2008-10-03

* 2 bug fixes

  * restore colorized output in linux and windows w/ autotest (Tim Pope). Fixes #413.
  * autospec no longer hangs on windows. Fixes #554.

=== Version 1.1.7 / 2008-10-02

=== Version 1.1.6 / 2008-10-02

* 2 bug fixes

  * fixed bug where negative message expectations following stubs resulted in false (negative) positives (Mathias Meyer). Closes #548.
  * fixed bug where Not Yet Implemented examples report incorrect caller (Scott Taylor). Closes #547.

* 1 minor enhancement

  * removed deprecated mock argument constraint symbols

=== Version 1.1.5 / 2008-09-28

IMPORTANT: use the new 'autospec' command instead of 'autotest'. We changed
the way autotest discovers rspec so the autotest executable won't
automatically load rspec anymore. This allows rspec to live side by side other
spec frameworks without always co-opting autotest through autotest's discovery
mechanism.

ALSO IMPORTANT: $rspec_options is gone. If you were using this for anything
(like your own runners), use Spec::Runner.options instead.

ADDITIONALLY IMPORTANT: If you have any custom formatters, you'll need to
modify #example_pending to accept three arguments instead of just two. See the
rdoc for Spec::Runner::Formatter::BaseFormatter#example_pending for more
information.

* Warning messages now issued when expectations are set on nil (Ben Mabey)

=== Version 1.1.4

=== Version 1.1.0-RC1

Textmate Bundle users - this release adds a new RSpec bundle that highlights describe, it, before and after and
provides navigation to descriptions and examples (rather than classes and methods). When you first install this,
it is going to try to hijack all of your .rb files. All you need to do is open a .rb file that does not end with
'spec.rb' and change the bundle selection from RSpec to Ruby. TextMate will do the right thing from then on.

Shortcuts for tab-activated snippets all follow the TextMate convention of 2 or 3 letters of the first word, followed by the first letter of each subsequent word. So "should have_at_least" would be triggered by shhal.

We reduced the scope for running spec directories, files, a single file or individual spec in TextMate to source.ruby.rspec. This allowed us to restore the standard Ruby shortcuts:

CMD-R runs all the specs in one file
CMD-SHIFT-R runs an individual spec
CMD-OPT-R runs any files or directories selected in the TextMate drawer

rspec_on_rails users - don't forget to run script/generate rspec

=== Version 1.0.8

Another bugfix release - this time to resolve the version mismatch

=== Version 1.0.7

Quick bugfix release to ensure that you don't have to have the rspec gem installed
in order to use autotest with rspec_on_rails.

* Fixed [#13015] autotest gives failure in 'spec_command' after upgrade 1.0.5 to 1.0.6

=== Version 1.0.6

The "holy cow, batman, it's been a long time since we released and there are a ton of bug
fixes, patches and even new features" release.

Warning: Spec::Rails users: In fixing 11508, we've removed the raise_controller_errors method. As long as you
follow the upgrade instructions and run 'script/generate rspec' you'll be fine, but if you skip this
step you need to manually go into spec_helper.rb and remove the call to that method (if present - it
might not be if you haven't upgraded in a while).

Warning: Implementors of custom formatters. Formatters will now be sent an Example object instead of just a
String for #example_started, #example_passed and #example_failed. In certain scenarios
(Spec::Ui with Spec::Distributed), the formatter must ask the Example for its sequence number instead of
keeping track of a sequence number internal to the formatter. Most of you shouldn't need to upgrade
your formatters though - the Example#to_s method returns the example name/description, so you should be
able to use the passed Example instance as if it were a String.

* Applied [#12986] Autotest Specs + Refactoring (Patch from Scott Tayler)
* Added a #close method to formatters, which allows them to gracefully close streams.

This is a maintenance release with mostly cleaning up, and one minor enhancement -
Modules are automatically included when described directly.

* Renamed Spec::Rails' rspec_resource generator to rspec_scaffold.
* Removed Spec::Rails' be_feed matcher since it's based on assert_select_feed which is not part of Rails (despite that docs for assert_select_encoded says it is).

=== Version 0.9.4
This release introduces massive improvements to Spec::Ui - the user interface functional testing
extension to RSpec. There are also some minor bug fixes to the RSpec core.

* Massive improvements to Spec::Ui. Complete support for all Watir's ie.xxx(how, what) methods. Inline screenshots and HTML.

* describe(SomeType, "message") will have a decription with a space: "SomeType message"
* Applied [#10566] prepend_before and prepend_after callbacks

=== Version 0.9.2
This is a quick maintenance release.

* Added some website love
* Fixed [#10542] reverse predicate matcher syntax
* Added a spec:translate Rake task to make 0.9 translation easier with Spec:Rails
* Better translation of should_redirect_to
* Fixed --colour support for Windows. This is a regression that was introduced in 0.9.1
* Applied [#10460] Make SpecRunner easier to instantiate without using commandline args

=== Version 0.9.1

This release introduces #describe and #it (aliased as #context and #specify for
backwards compatibility). This allows you to express specs like this:

  describe SomeClass do # Creates a Behaviour
    it "should do something" do # Creates an Example
    end
  end

The command line features four new options that give you more control over what specs
are being run and in what order. This can be used to verify that your specs are
independent (by running in opposite order with --reverse). It can also be used to cut
down feedback time by running the most recently modified specs first (--loadby mtime --reverse).

Further, --example replaces the old --spec option, and it can now take a file name of
spec names as an alternative to just a spec name. The --format failing_examples:file.txt
option allows you to output an --example compatible file, which makes it possible to only
rerun the specs that failed in the last run. Spec::Rails uses all of these four options
by default to optimise your RSpec experience.

There is now a simple configuration model. For Spec::Rails, you do something like this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    config.use_instantiated_fixtures  = false
    config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures'
  end

You can now use mocha or flexmock with RSpec if you prefer either to
RSpec's own mock framework. Just put this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :mocha
  end

or this:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.mock_with :flexmock
  end

in a file that is loaded before your specs. You can also
configure included modules and predicate_matchers:

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include SomeModule
    config.predicate_matchers[:does_something?] = :do_something
  end

See Spec::DSL::Behaviour for more on predicate_matchers

=== Version 0.8.2

Replaced assert_select fork with an assert_select wrapper for have_tag. This means that "should have_rjs" no longer supports :hide or :effect, but you can still use should_have_rjs for those.

=== Version 0.8.1

Quick "in house" bug-fix

=== Version 0.8.0

This release introduces a new approach to handling expectations using Expression Matchers.

See Upgrade[http://rspec.rubyforge.org/upgrade.html], Spec::Expectations, Spec::Matchers and RELEASE-PLAN for more info.

=== Version 0.7.0

This is the "Grow up and eat your own dog food release". RSpec is now used on itself and
we're no longer using Test::Unit to test it. Although, we are still extending Test::Unit
for the rails plugin (indirectly - through ZenTest)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE IS NOT 100% BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE TO 0.6.x

There are a few changes that will require that you change your existing specs.

RSpec now handles equality exactly like ruby does:

# actual.should_equal(expected) will pass if actual.equal?(expected) returns true
# actual.should eql(expected) will pass if actual.eql?(expected) returns true
# actual.should == expected will pass if actual == expected) returns true

At the high level, eql? implies equivalence, while equal? implies object identity. For more
information on how ruby deals w/ equality, you should do this:

ri equal?

or look at this:

http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Object.html#M001057

Also, we left in should_be as a synonym for should_equal, so the only specs that should break are the
ones using should_equal (which used to use <code>==</code> instead of <code>.equal?</code>).

Lastly, should_be used to handle true and false differently from any other values. We've removed
this special handling, so now actual.should_be true will fail for any value other than true (it
used to pass for any non-nil, non-false value), and actual.should_be false will fail for any
value other than false (it used to pass for nil or false).

Here's what you'll need to do to update your specs:
# search for "should_equal" and replace with "should_eql"
# run specs

If any specs still fail, they are probably related to should be_true or should_be_false using
non-boolean values. Those you'll just have to inspect manually and adjust appropriately (sorry!).

--------------------------------------------------
Specifying multiple return values in mocks now works like this:

mock.should_receive(:message).and_return(1,2,3)

It used to work like this:

mock.should_receive(:message).and_return([1,2,3])

but we decided that was counter intuitive and otherwise lame.

Here's what you'll need to do to update your specs:
# search for "and_return(["
# get rid of the "[" and "]"

--------------------------------------------------
RSpec on Rails now supports the following (thanks to ZenTest upon which it is built):

# Separate specs for models, views, controllers and helpers
# Controller specs are completely decoupled from the views by default (though you can tell them to couple themselves if you prefer)
# View specs are completely decoupled from app-specific controllers

See http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/rails/index.html for more information
--------------------------------------------------
As usual, there are also other new features and bug fixes:

* Added lots of documentation on mocks/stubs and the rails plugin.
* Added support for assigns[key] syntax for controller specs (to align w/ pre-existing syntax for view specs)
* Added support for controller.should_redirect_to
* RSpec on Rails automatically checks whether it's compatible with the installed RSpec
* Applied [#6393] rspec_on_rails uses deprecated '@response' instead of the accessor
* RSpec now has 100% spec coverage(!)

* Progress (....F..F.) is now coloured. Tweaked patch from KAKUTANI Shintaro.
* Backtrace now excludes the rcov runner (/usr/local/bin/rcov)
* Fixed [#5539] predicates do not work w/ rails
* Added [#6091] support for Regexp matching messages sent to should_raise
* Added [#6333] support for Regexp matching in mock arguments

* Fixed [#6233] Colours in specdoc
* Applied [#6207] Allows --diff option to diff target and expected's #inspect output (Patch by Lachie Cox)
* Fixed [#6203] Failure messages are misleading - consider using inspect.
* Added [#6334] subject.should_have_xyz will try to call subject.has_xyz? - use this for hash.should_have_key(key)
* Fixed [#6017] Rake task should ignore empty or non-existent spec-dirs

=== Version 0.6.4

In addition to a number of bug fixes and patches, this release begins to formalize the support for
RSpec on Rails.

* Added Christopher Petrilli's TextMate bundle to vendor/textmate/RSpec.tmbundle
* Fixed [#5909], once again supporting multi_word_predicates
* Applied [#5873] - response.should_have_rjs (initial patch from Jake Howerton, based on ARTS by Kevin Clark)

* Applied [#5815] active_record_subclass.should_have(3).records
* Added support in "rake stats" for view specs (in spec/views)
* Applied [#5801] QuickRef.pdf should say RSpec, not rSpec

* Applied [#5708] RSpec Rails plugin rspec_controller generator makes specs that do not parse.
* Cleaned up RSpec on Rails so it doesn't pollute as much during bootstrapping.
* Added support for response.should_have_tag and response.should_not_have_tag (works just like assert_tag in rails)
* Added new -c, --colour, --color option for colourful (red/green) output. Inspired from Pat Eyler's Redgreen gem.
* Added examples for Watir and Selenium under the gem's vendor directory.
* Renamed rails_spec_runner to rails_spec_server (as referred to in the docs)
* Added support for trying a plural for arbitrary predicates.  E.g. Album.should_exist(:name => "Hey Jude") will call Album.exists?(:name => "Hey Jude")
* Added support for should_have to work with methods taking args returning a collection.  E.g. @dave.should_have(3).albums_i_have_that_this_guy_doesnt(@aslak)
* Added [#5570] should_not_receive(:msg).with(:specific, "args")
* Applied [#5065] to support using define_method rather than method_missing to capture expected messages on mocks. Thanks to Eero Saynatkari for the tip that made it work.
* Restructured directories and Modules in order to separate rspec into three distinct Modules: Spec::Expectations, Spec::Runner and Spec::Mocks. This will allow us to more easily integrate other mock frameworks and/or allow test/unit users to take advantage of the expectation API.
* Applied [#5620] support any boolean method and arbitrary comparisons (5.should_be < 6) (Patch from Mike Williams)

=== Version 0.6.3

This release fixes some minor bugs related to RSpec on Rails

* Applied [#5525] fix rake task path to spec tool for gem-installed rspec (patch from Riley Lynch)
* Fixed a teensey regression with the rake task - introduced in 0.6.1. The spec command is now quoted so it works on windows.

=== Version 0.6.1
This is the "fix the most annoying bugs release" of RSpec. There are 9 bugfixes this time.
Things that may break backwards compatibility:
1) Spec::Rake::SpecTask no longer has the options attribute. Use ruby_opts, spec_opts and rcov_opts instead.

* Converted ALL tests to use underscore syntax
* Fixed all remaining problems with underscores revealed by converting all the tests to underscores

This release introduces better ways to extend specs, improves some of the core API and
a experimental support for faster rails specs.

* Added support for comparing exception message in should_raise and should_not_raise

=== Version 0.5.13
This release fixes some subtle bugs in the mock API.

* Use fully-qualified class name of Exceptions in failure message. Easier to debug that way.
