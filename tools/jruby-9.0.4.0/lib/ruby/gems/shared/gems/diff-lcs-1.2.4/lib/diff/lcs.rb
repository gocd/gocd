#
# Computes "intelligent" differences between two sequenced Enumerables. This
# is an implementation of the McIlroy-Hunt "diff" algorithm for Enumerable
# objects that include Diffable.
#
# Based on Mario I. Wolczko's Smalltalk version (1.2, 1993) and Ned Konz's
# Perl version (Algorithm::Diff 1.15).
#
# == Synopsis
#   require 'diff/lcs'
#
#   seq1 = %w(a b c e h j l m n p)
#   seq2 = %w(b c d e f j k l m r s t)
#
#   lcs = Diff::LCS.lcs(seq1, seq2)
#   diffs = Diff::LCS.diff(seq1, seq2)
#   sdiff = Diff::LCS.sdiff(seq1, seq2)
#   seq = Diff::LCS.traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
#   bal = Diff::LCS.traverse_balanced(seq1, seq2, callback_obj)
#   seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch(seq1, diffs)
#   seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, diffs)
#   seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch(seq2, diffs)
#   seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, diffs)
#   seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch(seq1, sdiff)
#   seq2 == Diff::LCS.patch!(seq1, sdiff)
#   seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch(seq2, sdiff)
#   seq1 == Diff::LCS.unpatch!(seq2, sdiff)
#
# Alternatively, objects can be extended with Diff::LCS:
#
#   seq1.extend(Diff::LCS)
#   lcs = seq1.lcs(seq2)
#   diffs = seq1.diff(seq2)
#   sdiff = seq1.sdiff(seq2)
#   seq = seq1.traverse_sequences(seq2, callback_obj)
#   bal = seq1.traverse_balanced(seq2, callback_obj)
#   seq2 == seq1.patch(diffs)
#   seq2 == seq1.patch!(diffs)
#   seq1 == seq2.unpatch(diffs)
#   seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(diffs)
#   seq2 == seq1.patch(sdiff)
#   seq2 == seq1.patch!(sdiff)
#   seq1 == seq2.unpatch(sdiff)
#   seq1 == seq2.unpatch!(sdiff)
#
# Default extensions are provided for Array and String objects through the
# use of 'diff/lcs/array' and 'diff/lcs/string'.
#
# == Introduction (by Mark-Jason Dominus)
#
# <em>The following text is from the Perl documentation. The only changes
# have been to make the text appear better in Rdoc</em>.
#
# I once read an article written by the authors of +diff+; they said that
# they hard worked very hard on the algorithm until they found the right
# one.
#
# I think what they ended up using (and I hope someone will correct me,
# because I am not very confident about this) was the `longest common
# subsequence' method. In the LCS problem, you have two sequences of items:
#
#    a b c d f g h j q z
#    a b c d e f g i j k r x y z
#
# and you want to find the longest sequence of items that is present in both
# original sequences in the same order. That is, you want to find a new
# sequence *S* which can be obtained from the first sequence by deleting
# some items, and from the second sequence by deleting other items. You also
# want *S* to be as long as possible. In this case *S* is:
#
#    a b c d f g j z
#
# From there it's only a small step to get diff-like output:
#
#    e   h i   k   q r x y
#    +   - +   +   - + + +
#
# This module solves the LCS problem. It also includes a canned function to
# generate +diff+-like output.
#
# It might seem from the example above that the LCS of two sequences is
# always pretty obvious, but that's not always the case, especially when the
# two sequences have many repeated elements. For example, consider
#
#    a x b y c z p d q
#    a b c a x b y c z
#
# A naive approach might start by matching up the +a+ and +b+ that appear at
# the beginning of each sequence, like this:
#
#    a x b y c         z p d q
#    a   b   c a b y c z
#
# This finds the common subsequence +a b c z+. But actually, the LCS is +a x
# b y c z+:
#
#          a x b y c z p d q
#    a b c a x b y c z

  # The arguments to #traverse_sequences are the two sequences to traverse,

  #   traverse_sequences(seq1, seq2, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallbacks.new)
  #
  # == Callback Methods
  #
  # Optional callback methods are <em>emphasized</em>.
  #
  # callbacks#match::               Called when +a+ and +b+ are pointing to
  #                                 common elements in +A+ and +B+.
  # callbacks#discard_a::           Called when +a+ is pointing to an
  #                                 element not in +B+.
  # callbacks#discard_b::           Called when +b+ is pointing to an
  #                                 element not in +A+.
  # <em>callbacks#finished_a</em>:: Called when +a+ has reached the end of
  #                                 sequence +A+.
  # <em>callbacks#finished_b</em>:: Called when +b+ has reached the end of
  #                                 sequence +B+.
  #
  # == Algorithm
  #
  #       a---+
  #           v
  #       A = a b c e h j l m n p
  #       B = b c d e f j k l m r s t
  #           ^
  #       b---+
  #
  # If there are two arrows (+a+ and +b+) pointing to elements of sequences
  # +A+ and +B+, the arrows will initially point to the first elements of
  # their respective sequences. #traverse_sequences will advance the arrows
  # through the sequences one element at a time, calling a method on the
  # user-specified callback object before each advance. It will advance the
  # arrows in such a way that if there are elements <tt>A[i]</tt> and
  # <tt>B[j]</tt> which are both equal and part of the longest common
  # subsequence, there will be some moment during the execution of
  # #traverse_sequences when arrow +a+ is pointing to <tt>A[i]</tt> and
  # arrow +b+ is pointing to <tt>B[j]</tt>. When this happens,
  # #traverse_sequences will call <tt>callbacks#match</tt> and then it will
  # advance both arrows.
  #
  # Otherwise, one of the arrows is pointing to an element of its sequence
  # that is not part of the longest common subsequence. #traverse_sequences
  # will advance that arrow and will call <tt>callbacks#discard_a</tt> or
  # <tt>callbacks#discard_b</tt>, depending on which arrow it advanced. If
  # both arrows point to elements that are not part of the longest common
  # subsequence, then #traverse_sequences will advance one of them and call
  # the appropriate callback, but it is not specified which it will call.
  #
  # The methods for <tt>callbacks#match</tt>, <tt>callbacks#discard_a</tt>,
  # and <tt>callbacks#discard_b</tt> are invoked with an event comprising
  # the action ("=", "+", or "-", respectively), the indicies +i+ and +j+,
  # and the elements <tt>A[i]</tt> and <tt>B[j]</tt>. Return values are
  # discarded by #traverse_sequences.
  #
  # === End of Sequences
  #
  # If arrow +a+ reaches the end of its sequence before arrow +b+ does,
  # #traverse_sequence will try to call <tt>callbacks#finished_a</tt> with
  # the last index and element of +A+ (<tt>A[-1]</tt>) and the current index
  # and element of +B+ (<tt>B[j]</tt>). If <tt>callbacks#finished_a</tt>
  # does not exist, then <tt>callbacks#discard_b</tt> will be called on each
  # element of +B+ until the end of the sequence is reached (the call will
  # be done with <tt>A[-1]</tt> and <tt>B[j]</tt> for each element).
  #
  # If +b+ reaches the end of +B+ before +a+ reaches the end of +A+,
  # <tt>callbacks#finished_b</tt> will be called with the current index and
  # element of +A+ (<tt>A[i]</tt>) and the last index and element of +B+
  # (<tt>A[-1]</tt>). Again, if <tt>callbacks#finished_b</tt> does not exist
  # on the callback object, then <tt>callbacks#discard_a</tt> will be called
  # on each element of +A+ until the end of the sequence is reached
  # (<tt>A[i]</tt> and <tt>B[-1]</tt>).
  #
  # There is a chance that one additional <tt>callbacks#discard_a</tt> or
  # <tt>callbacks#discard_b</tt> will be called after the end of the
  # sequence is reached, if +a+ has not yet reached the end of +A+ or +b+
  # has not yet reached the end of +B+.

  }

  # Applies a +patchset+ to the sequence +src+ according to the +direction+
  # (<tt>:patch</tt> or <tt>:unpatch</tt>), producing a new sequence.
  #
  # If the +direction+ is not specified, Diff::LCS::patch will attempt to
  # discover the direction of the +patchset+.
  #
  # A +patchset+ can be considered to apply forward (<tt>:patch</tt>) if the
  # following expression is true:
  #
  #     patch(s1, diff(s1, s2)) -> s2
  #
  # A +patchset+ can be considered to apply backward (<tt>:unpatch</tt>) if
  # the following expression is true:
  #
  #     patch(s2, diff(s1, s2)) -> s1
  #
  # If the +patchset+ contains no changes, the +src+ value will be returned
  # as either <tt>src.dup</tt> or +src+. A +patchset+ can be deemed as
  # having no changes if the following predicate returns true:
  #
  #     patchset.empty? or
  #       patchset.flatten.all? { |change| change.unchanged? }
  #
  # === Patchsets
  #
  # A +patchset+ is always an enumerable sequence of changes, hunks of
  # changes, or a mix of the two. A hunk of changes is an enumerable
  # sequence of changes:
  #
  #     [ # patchset
  #       # change
  #       [ # hunk
  #         # change
  #       ]
  #     ]
  #
  # The +patch+ method accepts <tt>patchset</tt>s that are enumerable
  # sequences containing either Diff::LCS::Change objects (or a subclass) or
  # the array representations of those objects. Prior to application, array
  # representations of Diff::LCS::Change objects will be reified.
