  * Fix an issue with priority comparison in the 1.x release series. Found by
    sdbondi. This issue does not exist in the 2.x release series.
    https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/47

== 1.25 / 2013-08-30

* New Features:
  * Adding lazy loading and caching functionality to the default data based on
    work done by Greg Brockman (gdb).
* Bugs:
  * Force the default internal application encoding to be used when reading the
    MIME types database. Based on a change by briangamble, found in the rapid7
    fork.
* New extensions:
  * mjpeg (video/x-motion-jpeg) based on a change by punkrats, found in the
    vidibus fork.
* Modernized MiniTest configuration.

== 1.24 / 2013-08-14

* Code Climate:
  * Working on improving the quality of the mime-types codebase through the use
    of Code Climate. https://codeclimate.com/github/halostatue/mime-types
  * Simplified MIME::Type.from_array to make more assumptions about assignment.
* Documentation:
  * LeoYoung <mrleoyoung@gmail.com> pointed out that the README.rdoc contained
    examples that could never possibly work because MIME::Types#[] returns (for
    all the versions I have handy) an array, not a single type. I have updated
    README.rdoc to reflect this.
* Removed Nokogiri as a declared development dependency. It is still required
  if you're going to use the IANA parser functionality, but it is not necessary
  for most development purposes. This has been removed to ensure that Travis CI
  passes on Ruby 1.8.7.
* New MIME Types:
  * 7zip (application/x-7z-compressed). Fixes a request by kodram.
    https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/32

== 1.23 / 2013-04-20

* New Feature:
  * Arnaud Meuret (ameuret) suggested that it could be useful if the MIME type
    collection was enumerable, so he implemented it in #30. Thanks for the
    contribution! https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/pull/30
* Updated MIME Types:
  * RFC6910 was adopted (application/call-completion).
  * RFC6902 was adopted (application/json-patch\+json).
  * RFC6917 was adopted (application/mrb-consumer\+xml,
    application/mrb-publish\+xml).
  * RFC6922 was adopted (application/sql).
  * RFC2560 is being
    {updated}[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-rfc2560bis].
* Administrivia:

* New MIME Types:
  * Types reported in https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/6:
    * CoffeeScript (text/x-coffeescript; .coffee; 8bit).
    * AIR (application/vnd.adobe.air-applicationinstaller-package+zip, .air; base64).
    * WOFF (application/font-woff; .woff; base64).

== 1.17.2 / 2011-10-25
* Bug Fixes:
  * Fixed an issue with Ruby 1.9 and file encoding.

== 1.17.1 / 2011-10-23
* Minor Enhancements:
  * Implemented modern 'hoe' semantics.
  * Switched to minitest instead of test/unit.
  * Converted documentation from .txt to .rdoc.
  * Removed setup.rb. https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/3
  * Should no longer complain about missing RubyGems keys https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/2
  * Added .mp4 and .mpg4 as recognized extensions for
    {application,audio,video}/mp4 per RFC4337. https://github.com/halostatue/mime-types/issues/1
  * Added audio/x-aac and .aac per RubyForge issue #28054
    (http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=28054&group_id=293&atid=1194).
  * Made it much easier to update MIME types from this point forward.
  * Updated MIME types from IANA.

== 1.16
* Made compatible with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, and 1.9.1.
* Switched to the 'hoe' gem system and added a lot of build-time tools.
* Updated the MIME types to the list based on the values in the Perl library
  version 1.27. Also updated based on external source information and bug
  reports.
* This is the last planned version of MIME::Types 1.x. Work will be
  starting soon on MIME::Types 2.x with richer data querying mechanisms
  and support for external data sources.

== 1.15
* Removed lib/mime/type.rb to form a single MIME::Types database source. It
  is unlikely that one will ever need MIME::Type without MIME::Types.
* Re-synchronized the MIME type list with the sources, focusing primarily on
  the IANA list.
* Added more detailed source information for MIME::Type objects.
* Changed MIME::Types from a module to a class with a default instance. There
  should be no difference in usage.
* Removed MIME::Types::DATA_VERSION; it is now an attribute on the
  MIME::Types instance.
* NOTE: Synchronization with the Perl version of MIME::Types is no longer a
  priority as of this release. The data format and information has changed.
* Removed MIME::Types.by_suffix and MIME::Types.by_mediatype.

== 1.13.1
* Fixed a problem with the installer running tests. This now works.
* Improved the implementation of MIME::Type.signature?
* Moved code around to use the class << self idiom instead of always
  prepending the module/class name.
* Added two new best-guess implementations of functions found in Perl's
  MIME::Types implementation (1.13). Do not rely on these until the purpose
  and implementation is stabilised.
* Updated the MIME list to reflect changes noted by
  Ville SkyttÃ¤ <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.
* Added a new constant to MIME::Types, DATA_VERSION. This will allow the Ruby
  version number to be updated separately from the Perl version while keeping
  the MIME Type list version in sync.

== 1.13
  ! WARNING: This version changes the API of MIME::Types !
  ! WARNING: This version is compatible with Ruby 1.8 and higher ONLY !
* Removed dependency on InstallPackage; offering 1.13 as either .tar.gz or
  .gem.
* Split into two files, mime/type.rb and mime/types.rb. This will make
  maintaining the list of changes easier.
* Changed the MIME::Type construction API. Accepts only a single String
  argument (but does no named type-checking) and yields self.
* Removed private methods #init_extensions, #init_encoding, and #init_system
  and replaced with #extensions=, #encoding=, and #system=.
* Added #default_encoding to return 'quoted-printable' or 'base64' depending
  on the media type of the MIME type.
* Added #raw_media_type and #raw_sub_type to provide the non-simplified
  versions of the media type and subtype.
* Alternative constructors MIME::Type.from_array, MIME::Type.from_hash, and
  MIME::Type.from_mime_type added to compensate for the removal of named type
  checking in the original constructor.
* Added #to_str, #to_a, and #to_hash methods. The latter two will provide
  output suitable for use in #from_array and #from_hash.
* Removed "binary" encoding and enforced the use of a valid encoding string.
* Added #system? returning true if the MIME::Type is an OS-specific
  MIME::Type.
* Added #platform? returning true if the MIME::Type is an OS-specific
  MIME::Type for the current RUBY_PLATFORM.
* Added #like? returning true if the simplified type matches the other value
  provided. #<'application/x-excel'>.like?('application/excel') is true.
* Added #complete? returning true if the MIME::Type specifies an extension
  list.
* Updated the MIME type list to reflect additions by Mark Overmeer for Perl's
  MIME::Types 1.12 and the official IANA list as of 2004.04.06. A number of
  formerly "registered" MIME types are now no longer registered (e.g.,
  application/excel is now application/x-excel). This ensures that the
  simplified type still works with applications, but does not report an
  unregistered type as registered.
* Restored MIME type list to Mark Overmeer's format to facilitate easy
  exchange between the two projects.
* Added additional unit tests from Mark Overmeer's 1.12 version.

== 1.07
* Changed version numbering to match Perl MIME::Types 1.07.
* Re-synchronized with Mark Overmeer's list in Perl PMIME::Types 1.07.
* [NN Poster] updated the attributes for the PGP types.

== 1.005
* Changed to Phil Thomson's InstallPackage.
* Added several types from Perl MIME::Types 1.005.
* Cleaned up data format; some data formats will show up with proper data now.

== 1.004
* Updated to match Perl MIME::Types 1.004, links credited to Dan Puro. Adds
  new reference list to http://www.indiana.edu/cgi-bin-local/mimetypes
* Removed InvalidType and replaced with TypeError.
* Changed instances of #type to #class.
* Cleaned up how simplified versions are created.

== 1.003
* Initial release based on Perl MIME::Types 1.003.
