    # == Sidekiq adapter for Active Job
    #
    # Simple, efficient background processing for Ruby. Sidekiq uses threads to
    # handle many jobs at the same time in the same process. It does not
    # require Rails but will integrate tightly with it to make background
    # processing dead simple.
    #
    # Read more about Sidekiq {here}[http://sidekiq.org].
    #
    # To use Sidekiq set the queue_adapter config to +:sidekiq+.
    #
    #   Rails.application.config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
