== 0.7.2 / 2011-07-06

* Patch by thomaslee to support method_missing in JRuby environments.

== 0.7.1 / 2010-07-20

* Support for Ruby 1.9 by removing the call to nitems.

== 0.7.0 / 2008-02-16

* Antwrap has been re-licensed under the Apache Software License. This was done to make Antwrap compatible with the Buildr project, and the Ant library.
* All Antwrap classes and modules are now contained inside an 'Antwrap' module. 

== 0.6.0 / 2007-06-18

* The Antwrap syntax was changed. Blocks passed to a task are no longer evaluated within the context of the task itself. Instead, the AntProject itself will now yield
to the block and pass itself as a parameter. While slightly more verbose, this is idiomatic Ruby and allows you to use objects and invoke methods that are not in the 
scope of the task.

The Old Way:

@ant.path(:id => "other.class.path"){        
    pathelement(:location => "classes")              
    pathelement(:location => "config")    
}                                    

The New Way:

def find_location
    return "classes"
end

@ant.path(:id => "other.class.path"){ |ant|
    ant.pathelement(:location => find_location())
    ant.pathelement(:location => "config")
}

== 0.5.4 / 2007-06-13

* Using an Array instance as a value to a task will result in an ArgumentError. This is to prevent situations where a user passes an array of files/paths and the :to_s method joins 
the contents together without an appropriate separator. For example; ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"].to_s --> "file1.txtfile2.txt" Instead, users are encouraged to do something 
like; ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"].join(File::PATH_SEPARATOR).to_s --> "file1.txt:file2.txt"

== 0.5.3 / 2007-06-13

* Antwrap now supports any attribute value that responds to the :to_s method. Fixnum, Boolean, and other objects can now be passed to a task. For example, the following code uses the 
'true' constant rather than the String 'true';

@ant.javac(:srcdir => @resource_dir + '/src', 
    :destdir => @output_dir + '/classes',
    :debug => true,
    :verbose => true)

== 0.5.2 / 2007-04-17

* The AntProject instance now accepts an :ant_home parameter in the constructor. If provided, it will attempt to add the Ant jar files to the Classpath dynamically. For 
example: @ant = AntProject.new(:ant_home=>\"/Users/fooman/tools/apache-ant-1.7.0\")

== 0.5.0 / 2007-03-16

* Added support for both the Ruby and JRuby platforms. The Ruby platform Antwrap gem depends on the Ruby Java Bridge (RJB) gem. The JRuby platform gem uses the JRuby's 'java' module.

== 0.4.0 / 2007-03-04

* Resolved some scope problems with keywords such as :mkdir, :java, etc.

== 0.3.0 / 2007-02-19

* Antwrap now supports Ant versions 1.5.4, 1.6.5, and 1.7.0.

== 0.2.0 / 2007-01-30

* Added support for Antcontrib tasks (those with reserved words such as if/else). The Antwrap convert script will prepend a task (that is a ruby reserved word) with an underscore.

== 0.1.0 / 2007-01-20

* Initial release of the Antwrap gem.
