   From review of https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22112 and the code of GoCD, GoCD does not appear to be
   subject to this defect, since it does not alter the security context in the manner required to elevate privileges
   in a small portion of the application and potentially be subject to this defect.

   GoCD is not subject to this defect, since at time of writing we do not use literals on the Criteria API (it's also
   unclear whether older Hibernate versions are subject to the same defect)

   From review of https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23463 GoCD is not subject to this XXE vulnerability, because
   neither GoCD, Hibernate or MyBatis use JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML(). It seems this is unlikely to get a backport to
   H2 1.4.x which is a breaking change. See https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3195 and

   https://jfrog.com/blog/the-jndi-strikes-back-unauthenticated-rce-in-h2-database-console/ only affects the H2 console
   (not enabled on GoCD) and context-dependent use of JdbcUtils.getConnection (not possible from remote properties in GoCD)
   so GoCD does not appear to be vulnerable to this problem.
