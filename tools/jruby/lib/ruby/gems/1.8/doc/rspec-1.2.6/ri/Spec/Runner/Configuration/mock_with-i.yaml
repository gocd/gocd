    This is simply a module that responds to the following methods:'

  body: "  setup_mocks_for_rspec\n  verify_mocks_for_rspec\n  teardown_mocks_for_rspec.\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'These are your hooks into the lifecycle of a given example. RSpec will call
    setup_mocks_for_rspec before running anything else in each Example. After executing
    the #after methods, RSpec will then call verify_mocks_for_rspec and teardown_mocks_for_rspec
    (this is guaranteed to run even if there are failures in verify_mocks_for_rspec).'

  body: 'Once you''ve defined this module, you can pass that to mock_with:'
