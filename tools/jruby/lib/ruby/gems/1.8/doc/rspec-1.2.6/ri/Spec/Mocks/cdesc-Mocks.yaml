  text: Mocks and Stubs
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: RSpec will create Mock Objects and Stubs for you at runtime, or attach stub/mock
    behaviour to any of your real objects (Partial Mock/Stub). Because the underlying
    implementation for mocks and stubs is the same, you can intermingle mock and stub
    behaviour in either dynamically generated mocks or your pre-existing classes.
    There is a semantic difference in how they are created, however, which can help
    clarify the role it is playing within a given spec.

  text: Mock Objects
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Mocks are objects that allow you to set and verify expectations that they
    will receive specific messages during run time. They are very useful for specifying
    how the subject of the spec interacts with its collaborators. This approach is
    widely known as &quot;interaction testing&quot;.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Mocks are also very powerful as a design tool. As you are driving the implementation
    of a given class, Mocks provide an anonymous collaborator that can change in behaviour
    as quickly as you can write an expectation in your spec. This flexibility allows
    you to design the interface of a collaborator that often does not yet exist. As
    the shape of the class being specified becomes more clear, so do the requirements
    for its collaborators - often leading to the discovery of new types that are needed
    in your system.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Read Endo-Testing[http://www.mockobjects.com/files/endotesting.pdf] for a
    much more in depth description of this process.

  text: Stubs
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Stubs are objects that allow you to set &quot;stub&quot; responses to messages.
    As Martin Fowler points out on his site, mocks_arent_stubs[http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html].
    Paraphrasing Fowler''s paraphrasing of Gerard Meszaros: Stubs provide canned responses
    to messages they might receive in a test, while mocks allow you to specify and,
    subsquently, verify that certain messages should be received during the execution
    of a test.'

  level: 2
  text: Partial Mocks/Stubs
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: RSpec also supports partial mocking/stubbing, allowing you to add stub/mock
    behaviour to instances of your existing classes. This is generally something to
    be avoided, because changes to the class can have ripple effects on seemingly
    unrelated specs. When specs fail due to these ripple effects, the fact that some
    methods are being mocked can make it difficult to understand why a failure is
    occurring.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: That said, partials do allow you to expect and verify interactions with class
    methods such as +#find+ and +#create+ on Ruby on Rails model classes.
