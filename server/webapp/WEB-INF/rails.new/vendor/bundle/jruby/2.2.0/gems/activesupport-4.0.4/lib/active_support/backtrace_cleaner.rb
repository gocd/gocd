  # Backtraces often include many lines that are not relevant for the context
  # under review. This makes it hard to find the signal amongst the backtrace
  # noise, and adds debugging time. With a BacktraceCleaner, filters and
  # silencers are used to remove the noisy lines, so that only the most relevant
  # lines remain.
  #
  # Filters are used to modify lines of data, while silencers are used to remove
  # lines entirely. The typical filter use case is to remove lengthy path
  # information from the start of each line, and view file paths relevant to the
  # app directory instead of the file system root. The typical silencer use case
  # is to exclude the output of a noisy library from the backtrace, so that you
  # can focus on the rest.
  #
  #   bc = BacktraceCleaner.new
  #   bc.add_filter   { |line| line.gsub(Rails.root, '') }
  #   bc.add_silencer { |line| line =~ /mongrel|rubygems/ }
  #   bc.clean(exception.backtrace) # will strip the Rails.root prefix and skip any lines from mongrel or rubygems
  #
  # To reconfigure an existing BacktraceCleaner (like the default one in Rails)
  # and show as much data as possible, you can always call
  # <tt>BacktraceCleaner#remove_silencers!</tt>, which will restore the
  # backtrace to a pristine state. If you need to reconfigure an existing
  # BacktraceCleaner so that it does not filter or modify the paths of any lines
  # of the backtrace, you can call BacktraceCleaner#remove_filters! These two
  # methods will give you a completely untouched backtrace.
  #
  # Inspired by the Quiet Backtrace gem by Thoughtbot.
