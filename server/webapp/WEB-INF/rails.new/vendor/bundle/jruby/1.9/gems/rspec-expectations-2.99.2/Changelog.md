### 2.99.2 / 2014-07-21
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.99.1...2-99-maintenance)

Bug Fixes:

* Fix regression in `Expectations#method_handle_for` where proxy objects
  with method delegated would wrongly not return a method handle.
  (Jon Rowe, #594)
* Fix issue with detection of generic operator matchers so they work
  correctly when undefined. (Myron Marston, #597)

### 2.99.1 / 2014-06-19
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.99.0...v2.99.1)

Bug Fixes:

* Fix typo in custom matcher `expected` deprecation warning -- it's
  `expected_as_array`, not `expected_array`. (Frederick Cheung, #562)

### 2.99.0 / 2014-06-01
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.99.0.rc1...v2.99.0)

Enhancements:

* Special case deprecation message for `errors_on` with `rspec-rails` to be more useful.
  (Aaron Kromer)

### 2.99.0.rc1 / 2014-05-18
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.99.0.beta2...2.99.0.rc1)

Deprecations:

* Deprecate `matcher_execution_context` attribute on DSL-defined
  custom matchers. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `RSpec::Matchers::Pretty#_pretty_print`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `RSpec::Matchers::Pretty#expected_to_sentence`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `RSpec::Matchers::Configuration` in favor of
  `RSpec::Expectations::Configuration`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `be_xyz` predicate matcher on an object that doesn't respond to
  `xyz?` or `xyzs?`. (Daniel Fone)
* Deprecate `have_xyz` matcher on an object that doesn't respond to `has_xyz?`.
  (Daniel Fone)
* Deprecate `have_xyz` matcher on an object that has a private method `has_xyz?`.
  (Jon Rowe)
* Issue a deprecation warning when a block expectation expression is
  used with a matcher that doesn't explicitly support block expectations
  via `supports_block_expectations?`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `require 'rspec-expectations'`. Use
  `require 'rspec/expectations'` instead. (Myron Marston)

### 2.99.0.beta2 / 2014-02-17
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.99.0.beta1...v2.99.0.beta2)

Deprecations:

* Deprecate chaining `by`, `by_at_least`, `by_at_most` or `to` off of
  `expect { }.not_to change { }`. The docs have always said these are
  not supported for the negative form but now they explicitly raise
  errors in RSpec 3. (Myron Marston)
* Change the semantics of `expect { }.not_to change { x }.from(y)`.
  In RSpec 2.x, this expectation would only fail if `x` started with
  the value of `y` and changed. If it started with a different value
  and changed, it would pass. In RSpec 3, it will pass only if the
  value starts at `y` and it does not change. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `matcher == value` as an alias for `matcher.matches?(value)`,
  in favor of `matcher === value`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate `RSpec::Matchers::OperatorMatcher` in favor of
  `RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn::OperatorMatcher`. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate auto-integration with Test::Unit and minitest.
  Instead, include `RSpec::Matchers` in the appropriate test case
  base class yourself. (Myron Marston)
* Deprecate treating `#expected` on a DSL-generated custom matcher
  as an array when only 1 argument is passed to the matcher method.
  In RSpec 3 it will be the single value in order to make diffs
  work properly. (Jon Rowe)

### 2.99.0.beta1 / 2013-11-07
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.4...v2.99.0.beta1)

Deprecations:

* Deprecate `have`, `have_at_least` and `have_at_most`. You can continue using those
	matchers through https://github.com/rspec/rspec-collection_matchers, or
	you can rewrite your expectations with something like
	`expect(your_object.size).to eq(num)`. (Hugo Bara√∫na)
* Deprecate `be_xyz` predicate matcher when `xyz?` is a private method.
  (Jon Rowe)
* Deprecate `be_true`/`be_false` in favour of `be_truthy`/`be_falsey`
  (for Ruby's conditional semantics) or `be true`/`be false`
  (for exact equality). (Sam Phippen)
* Deprecate calling helper methods from a custom matcher with the wrong
  scope. (Myron Marston)
  * `def self.foo` / `extend Helper` can be used to add macro methods
    (e.g. methods that call the custom matcher DSL methods), but should
    not be used to define helper methods called from within the DSL
    blocks.
  * `def foo` / `include Helper` is the opposite: it's for helper methods
    callable from within a DSL block, but not for defining macros.
  * RSpec 2.x allowed helper methods defined either way to be used for
    either purpose, but RSpec 3.0 will not.

### 2.14.5 / 2014-02-01
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.4...v2.14.5)

Bug fixes

* Fix wrong matcher descriptions with falsey expected value
  (yujinakayama)

### 2.14.4 / 2013-11-06
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.3...v2.14.4)

Bug fixes

* Make the `match` matcher produce a diff output. (Jon Rowe, Ben Moss)
* Choose encoding for diff's more intelligently, and when all else fails fall
  back to default internal encoding with replacing characters. (Jon Rowe)

### 2.14.3 / 2013-09-22
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.2...v2.14.3)

Bug fixes

* Fix operator matchers (`should` syntax) when `method` is redefined on target.
  (Brandon Turner)
* Fix diffing of hashes with object based keys. (Jon Rowe)
* Fix operator matchers (`should` syntax) when operator is defined via
  `method_missing` (Jon Rowe)

### 2.14.2 / 2013-08-14
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.1...v2.14.2)

Bug fixes

* Fix `be_<predicate>` matcher to not support operator chaining like the
  `be` matcher does (e.g. `be == 5`). This led to some odd behaviors
  since `be_<predicate> == anything` returned a `BeComparedTo` matcher
  and was thus always truthy. This was a consequence of the implementation
  (e.g. subclassing the basic `Be` matcher) and was not intended behavior.
  (Myron Marston).
* Fix `change` matcher to compare using `==` in addition to `===`. This
  is important for an expression like:
  `expect {}.to change { a.class }.from(ClassA).to(ClassB)` because
  `SomeClass === SomeClass` returns false. (Myron Marston)

### 2.14.1 / 2013-08-08
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.0...2.14.1)

Bug fixes

* Ensure diff output uses the same encoding as the encoding of
  the string being diff'd to prevent `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError`
  errors (Jon Rowe).

### 2.14.0 / 2013-07-06
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.14.0.rc1...v2.14.0)

Bug fixes

* Values that are not matchers use `#inspect`, rather than `#description` for
  documentation output (Andy Lindeman, Sam Phippen).
* Make `expect(a).to be_within(x).percent_of(y)` work with negative y
  (Katsuhiko Nishimra).
* Make the `be_predicate` matcher work as expected used with `expect{...}.to
  change...`  (Sam Phippen).

### 2.14.0.rc1 / 2013-05-27
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.13.0...v2.14.0.rc1)

Enhancements

* Enhance `yield_control` so that you can specify an exact or relative
  number of times: `expect { }.to yield_control.exactly(3).times`,
  `expect { }.to yield_control.at_least(2).times`, etc (Bartek
  Borkowski).
* Make the differ that is used when an expectation fails better handle arrays
  by splitting each element of the array onto its own line. (Sam Phippen)
* Accept duck-typed strings that respond to `:to_str` as expectation messages.
  (Toby Ovod-Everett)

Bug fixes

* Fix differ to not raise errors when dealing with differently-encoded
  strings (Jon Rowe).
* Fix `expect(something).to be_within(x).percent_of(y)` where x and y are both
  integers (Sam Phippen).
* Fix `have` matcher to handle the fact that on ruby 2.0,
  `Enumerator#size` may return nil (Kenta Murata).
* Fix `expect { raise s }.to raise_error(s)` where s is an error instance
  on ruby 2.0 (Sam Phippen).
* Fix `expect(object).to raise_error` passing. This now warns the user and
  fails the spec (tomykaira).

Deprecations

* Deprecate `expect { }.not_to raise_error(SpecificErrorClass)` or
  `expect { }.not_to raise_error("some specific message")`. Using
  these was prone to hiding failures as they would allow _any other
  error_ to pass. (Sam Phippen and David Chelimsky)

### 2.13.0 / 2013-02-23
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.12.1...v2.13.0)

Enhancements

* Add support for percent deltas to `be_within` matcher:
  `expect(value).to be_within(10).percent_of(expected)`
  (Myron Marston).
* Add support to `include` matcher to allow it to be given a list
  of matchers as the expecteds to match against (Luke Redpath).

Bug fixes

* Fix `change` matcher so that it dups strings in order to handle
  mutated strings (Myron Marston).
* Fix `should be =~ /some regex/` / `expect(...).to be =~ /some regex/`.
  Previously, these either failed with a confusing `undefined method
  matches?' for false:FalseClass` error or were no-ops that didn't
  actually verify anything (Myron Marston).
* Add compatibility for diff-lcs 1.2 and relax the version
  constraint (Peter Goldstein).
* Fix DSL-generated matchers to allow multiple instances of the
  same matcher in the same example to have different description
  and failure messages based on the expected value (Myron Marston).
* Prevent `undefined method #split for Array` error when dumping
  the diff of an array of multiline strings (Myron Marston).
* Don't blow up when comparing strings that are in an encoding
  that is not ASCII compatible (Myron Marston).
* Remove confusing "Check the implementation of #==" message
  printed for empty diffs (Myron Marston).

### 2.12.1 / 2012-12-15
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.12.0...v2.12.1)

Bug fixes

* Improve the failure message for an expression like
  `{}.should =~ {}`. (Myron Marston and Andy Lindeman)
* Provide a `match_regex` alias so that custom matchers
  built using the matcher DSL can use it (since `match`
  is a different method in that context).
  (Steven Harman)

### 2.12.0 / 2012-11-12
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.11.3...v2.12.0)

Enhancements

* Colorize diffs if the `--color` option is configured. (Alex Coplan)
* Include backtraces in unexpected errors handled by `raise_error`
  matcher (Myron Marston)
* Print a warning when users accidentally pass a non-string argument
  as an expectation message (Sam Phippen)
* `=~` and `match_array` matchers output a more useful error message when
  the actual value is not an array (or an object that responds to `#to_ary`)
  (Sam Phippen)

Bug fixes

* Fix `include` matcher so that `expect({}).to include(:a => nil)`
  fails as it should (Sam Phippen).
* Fix `be_an_instance_of` matcher so that `Class#to_s` is used in the
  description rather than `Class#inspect`, since some classes (like
  `ActiveRecord::Base`) define a long, verbose `#inspect`.
  (Tom Stuart)

### 2.11.3 / 2012-09-04
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.11.2...v2.11.3)

Bug fixes

* Fix (and deprecate) `expect { }.should` syntax so that it works even
  though it was never a documented or intended syntax. It worked as a
  consequence of the implementation of `expect` in RSpec 2.10 and
  earlier. (Myron Marston)
* Ensure #== is defined on built in matchers so that they can be composed.
  For example:

    expect {
      user.emailed!
    }.to change { user.last_emailed_at }.to be_within(1.second).of(Time.zone.now)

### 2.11.2 / 2012-07-25
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.11.1...v2.11.2)

Bug fixes

* Define `should` and `should_not` on `Object` rather than `BasicObject`
  on MacRuby. On MacRuby, `BasicObject` is defined but is not the root
  of the object hierarchy. (Gabriel Gilder)

### 2.11.1 / 2012-07-08
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.11.0...v2.11.1)

Bug fixes

* Constrain `actual` in `be_within` matcher to values that respond to `-` instead
  of requiring a specific type.
    * `Time`, for example, is a legit alternative.

### 2.11.0 / 2012-07-07
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.10.0...v2.11.0)

Enhancements

* Expand `expect` syntax so that it supports expections on bare values
  in addition to blocks (Myron Marston).
* Add configuration options to control available expectation syntaxes
  (Myron Marston):
  * `RSpec.configuration.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :expect }`
  * `RSpec.configuration.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :should }`
  * `RSpec.configuration.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = [:should, :expect] }`
  * `RSpec.configuration.add_should_and_should_not_to Delegator`

Bug fixes

* Allow only `Numeric` values to be the "actual" in the `be_within` matcher.
  This prevents confusing error messages. (Su Zhang @zhangsu)
* Define `should` and `should_not` on `BasicObject` rather than `Kernel`
  on 1.9. This makes `should` and `should_not` work properly with
  `BasicObject`-subclassed proxy objects like `Delegator`. (Myron
  Marston)

### 2.10.0 / 2012-05-03
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.9.1...v2.10.0)

Enhancements

* Add new `start_with` and `end_with` matchers (Jeremy Wadsack)
* Add new matchers for specifying yields (Myron Marston):
    * `expect {...}.to yield_control`
    * `expect {...}.to yield_with_args(1, 2, 3)`
    * `expect {...}.to yield_with_no_args`
    * `expect {...}.to yield_successive_args(1, 2, 3)`
* `match_unless_raises` takes multiple exception args

Bug fixes

* Fix `be_within` matcher to be inclusive of delta.
* Fix message-specific specs to pass on Rubinius (John Firebaugh)

### 2.9.1 / 2012-04-03
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.9.0...v2.9.1)

* Fix bug diffing single strings with multiline strings.
* Fix for error with using custom matchers inside other custom matchers
  (mirasrael)

### 2.9.0 / 2012-03-17
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/compare/v2.8.0...v2.9.0)

Enhancements

* Move built-in matcher classes to RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn to reduce pollution
  of RSpec::Matchers (which is included in every example).
* Autoload files with matcher classes to improve load time.

Bug fixes

* Align `respond_to?` and `method_missing` in DSL-defined matchers.
* Clear out user-defined instance variables between invocations of DSL-defined
  matchers.
* Dup the instance of a DSL generated matcher so its state is not changed by
  subsequent invocations.
* Treat expected args consistently across positive and negative expectations
  (thanks to Ralf Kistner for the heads up)
