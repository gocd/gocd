    end
    
    def unencoded_subject(recipient)
      @recipients = recipient
      @subject    = "testing unencoded subject"

* Consolidated the server configuration options into Base#server_settings= and expanded that with controls for authentication and more [Marten]
  NOTE: This is an API change that could potentially break your application if you used the old application form. Please do change!

* Added Base#deliveries as an accessor for an array of emails sent out through that ActionMailer class when using the :test delivery option. [Jeremy Kemper]

  This is especially useful for functional testing that shouldn't send off real emails, but still trigger delivery_* methods.

  Sendmail is assumed to be present at "/usr/sbin/sendmail" if that option is used. [Kent Sibilev]
