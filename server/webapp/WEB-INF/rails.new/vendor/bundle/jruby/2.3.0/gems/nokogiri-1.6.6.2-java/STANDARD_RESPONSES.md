These responses are needed often enough that I figured, let's just

# Not enough information to help

Hello!

Thanks for asking this question! However, without more information,
Team Nokogiri cannot reproduce your issue, and so we cannot offer much
help.

Please provide us with:

* A self-contained script (one that we can run without modification,
  and preferably without making external network connections).

* Please note that you need to include the XML/HTML that you are
  operating on.

* The output of `nokogiri -v`, which will provide details about your
  platform and versions of ruby, libxml2 and nokogiri.

For more information about requesting help or reporting bugs, please
take a look at http://bit.ly/nokohelp

Thank you so much!
