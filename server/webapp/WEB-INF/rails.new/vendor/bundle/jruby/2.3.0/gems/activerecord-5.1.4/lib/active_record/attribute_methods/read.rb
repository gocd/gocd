          # sequences are duplicated and cached (in MRI).  define_method may
          # be slower on dispatch, but if you're careful about the closure

          # 'my_column(omg)'. So to work around this we first define with
          # the __temp__ identifier, and then use alias method to rename
          # it to what we want.
          #
          # We are also defining a constant to hold the frozen string of
          # the attribute name. Using a constant means that we do not have
          # to allocate an object on each call to the attribute method.
