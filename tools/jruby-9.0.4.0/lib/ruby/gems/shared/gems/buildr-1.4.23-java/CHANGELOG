1.4.23 (2015-06-12)
* Change: BUILDR-706 - Update the checkstyle addon use checkstyle 6.6. Submitted
          by Dieter Vrancken.
* Fixed:  Fix Buildr.rspec_present? so that it works under jruby 1.6.7.2
* Change: BUILDR-705 - Avoid attempting to load rspec classes unless Buildr.rspec_present?
          returns true. Reported By rbpandey.
* Fixed:  Remove debug output left in ipr.sql_dialect_mappings.

1.4.22 (2015-02-28)
* Change: BUILDR-704 - Updated the Sonar addon to support the latest version of SonarQube
          Runner. Submitted by Ross Mahony.
* Added:  Add support for ipr.add_glassfish_remote_configuration method that generates
          a remote glassfish configuration in IntelliJ IDEA project files.
* Added:  Add support for iml.prefix and ipr.prefix settings that prefix the generated
          IntelliJ IDEA project and module files.
* Change: Update the buildr gemspec so that rspec is no longer a required dependency.
          This enables end-users to use a different version of rspec and buildr in
          the same project. The rspec version MUST be be compatible with the version
          used by Buildr if rspec features are used from within Buildr. Buildr also
          issues a warning if the `check` method is called and rspec has not been loaded.
          The warning includes directions on how to resolve the issue. Submitted by r6p.
* Fixed:  A long standing bug existed such that if tests failed to compile, and the
          option Buildr.options.test is set to :all then the compilation error would
          not result in a failed build. As many people set the Buildr.options.test to
          :all in their continuous delivery/integration tools, this has caused some
          problems. This has been fixed by ensuring all the problems associated with
          the resolving the prerequisites are not caught when Buildr.options.test is
          set to :all.
* Change: Update checkstyle to 6.1.1. Submitted by neher.

          that artifacts, without forcing a compilation of dependency when parsing
          buildfile.
* Added:  Support configuration of sql dialect mapping in IDEA generated project files
          through methods on the ipr extension ipr.mssql_dialect_mapping,
          ipr.postgres_dialect_mapping and ipr.sql_dialect_mappings
* Added:  Support specification of the target project to which the gwt compilation
          artifacts are added as an asset, by using :target_project option.

* Fixed:  Change the name of the GlassFish install in ipr.add_glassfish_configuration
          to use the same convention that IDEA uses by default. i.e. Name the
          installation "GlassFish 4.1.0" rather than "Glassfish 4.1.0".
* Change: Change the default version of the jdk in IDEA project files to 1.7.
* Change: Change the default version of the IDEA project files created to the

(http://groups.google.com/group/buildr-talk/browse_thread/thread/4f2867a6dbbc19d4).
* Added: Hash.from_java_properties(string) and hash.to_java_properties.
* Changed: Buildr.options now wrap various environment variables instead of
duplicating them (HTTP_PROXY, NO_PROXY, TEST, DEBUG).
* Changed: No longer passing proxies to transports, instead they obtain them
from environment variables.
* Changed: Buildr now uses XJavaDoc 1.1 instead of 1.1-j5. If you need the
1.1-j5 fix, see here
http://groups.google.com/group/buildr-talk/browse_thread/thread/49f3226810466c94/1f0d25d002433fe2.
* Fixed: One RubyForge release for all packages, instead of one per package
(Anatol Pomozov).
* Fixed: buildr command does not recognize project tasks (foo:compile) or
default task (http://groups.google.com/group/buildr-talk/t/660061a0bc81989a).
* Fixed: Upload fails on SFTP permissions.
* Fixed: Hibernate.schema_export not passing Ant task when yielding.
* Fixed: IntelliJ Idea project files generation for projects more than two
degrees deep.

1.2.0 (2007-06-06)
* Added: Artifact.list returns specs for all registered artifacts (those
created with artifact or package).
* Added: Buildr.option.java_args are used when creating the RJB JVM, when
running a Java process (unless you override directly), and when running JUnit
tests (again, unless override).
* Added: TestNG support (test.using :testng).
* Added: You can run multiple tests from the command line, e.g. rake
test:foo,bar.
* Added: If you want to distribute source code and JavaDoc alongside your JARs
(helpful when using IDE/debugging), you can now do so by calling
package_with_sources and package_with_javadoc on the project (or the parent
project to affect all its sub-projects).
* Added: junit:report task generates XML and HTML reports in the reports/junit
directory.
* Added: test=all option runs all test cases ignoring failure.
* Added: project generation for IntelliJ Idea. Imports dependencies properly
from your local repository (the M2_REPO path variable must be defined),
supports tests and resources.
* Added: A check task for each project that runs after packaging and can be
used to check the build itself, using RSpec matchers.
* Added: The help task can be used to get basic information about your build.
Right now it returns a list of described tasks, but you can extend it using
the help method. Try it out: rake help.
* Added: Integration tests that run after packaging (unless tests are
disabled). There's only one integration tests task (duh) that you can access
from anywhere. You can tell a project to run its tests during the integration
phase with test.using :integration.
* Added: package :sources and package :javadoc, used by package_with_sources
and package_with_javadoc.
* Added: Unzip paths now return root/target. (Nathan)
* Added: buildr command line, replacing rake. Differs from rake in two ways:
uses buildfile by default (but Rakefile also works) and offers to create
buildfile if you don't already have one.
* Added: options.proxy.http now set from the environment variable HTTP_PROXY
(Anatol Pomozov).
* Added: options.java_args now set from environment variable JAVA_OPTIONS.
* Changed: Filter now complains if source directory or target directory not
set, or if source directory does not exist.
* Changed: Filter.run returns true if filter run, false otherwise, and can be
run multiple times.
* Changed: repositories.proxy returns a URI or nil; you can still set a proxy
using a hash.
* Changed: Transports went the way of the Dodo, instead we now use
read/write/download/upload methods implemented on URI itself.
* Changed: We now have a way to configure multiple proxies through the
options.proxy method; use that instead of repositories.proxies.
* Changed: Upgraded to Ant 1.7.0, JUnit 4.3, JMock 1.2.
* Changed: TestTask now provides list of test classes and failed classes
through test_classes and failed_tests attributes.
* Changed: The jetty method is now available everywhere, so you can change the
URL using jetty.url = at the top of the Rakefile. Also upgraded to 6.1.3.
* Changed: Test classes are now identified as either starting with Test* or
ending with *Test, before attempting any include/exclude patterns. Anything
ending with *TestCase or *Suite ignored for now (but if you explain why, we
can add it back).
* Changed: What used to be the projects task is now help:projects task,
anticipating more help: tasks to come.
* Changed: We now have 3(!) JDepend tasks: jdepend:swing (with windows!),
jdepend:text (console) and jdepend:xml (enterprisy).
* Changed: Good news for packagers: package_as_ yield no longer required, just
make sure to create the task once and return it each time.
* Changed: JUnit tests now run using Ant, which makes them faster to run, and
gives you text/XML reports (check out the reports/junit directory).
* Changed: Cobertura now writes reports to reports/cobertura, in fact, if
you're looking for a report of any kind, the reports directory is the place to
find it.
* Changed: Upgraded to AntWrap 0.6. Note that with AntWrap 0.6 we yield to the
block instead of doing instance_eval, so any call to the ant project must be
prefixed with an AntProject object. Code that relies on the old functionality
(and that's pretty much any code with element-containing tasks) will break.
* Changed: artifacts now accepts a struct.
* Changed: The repositories.download method folded into Artifact, the
repositories.deploy method renamed upload and folded into ActsAsArtifact.
* Changed: The deploy task is now called upload, and repositories.deploy_to is
now repositories.release_to.
* Removed: The check task, which previously was a way to find some circular
dependencies (multitask) but not others (dynamically defined).
* Removed: JUnitTask, test.junit and Java.junit methods all deprecated;
anything you need to affect the unit tests is right there in TestTask.
* Removed: The package(:jar) and package(:war) options, such as :manifest,
:include, :libs are all deprecated. Instead, use the package method to define
the package, and the with method to enhance it, e.g.
package(:war).with(:libs=>...) instead of package(:war, :libs=>...).
* Removed: The []= method on ZipTask and anything derived from it is
deprecated in favor of using attribute accessors.
* Removed: Ant.executable and Ant.declarative are deprecated. Use Buildr.ant
instead of Ant.executable. Use AntWrap directly if you need the
Ant.declarative functionality.
* Fixed: Filter now properly handles multiple keys on the same line.
* Fixed: Tests teardown now properly executing.
* Fixed: Cobertura tasks now run tests, even if test=no.
* Fixed: XMLBeans compile task not detecting change to XSD file.
* Fixed: URI.download and download task do not create directory path for
downloaded file (Anders Bengtsson).
* Fixed: Gets JVM version number from system property java.version instead of
calling java -version.
* Fixed: Artifact downloads POM first, such that you can download/create/fake
it youself.

1.1.3 (2007-06-12)
* Added: Long awaited idea project files generation. Very early code, the iml
seems to be generated okay but needs testing. The ipr is still missing but
will come in due time (and it's not always necessary anyway).
*Fixed: Doc bug: unzip doesn't have an into(dir) method.
*Fixed: File names don't always have a dot.
*Fixed: For Jetty servers, http://foo//bar is not http://foo/bar

1.1.2 (2007-05-29)
* Added: Allow passing :java_args option to the junit task
* Added: Hibernate XDoclet and SchemaExport tasks. (Requires buildr/hibernate)
* Added: JDepend UI for seeing depenencies across all projects. (Requires
buildr/jdepend)
* Added: Cobertura test coverage tasks, reporting both html and xml. (Requires
buildr/cobertura)
* Changed: tools_jar now returns empty array on OS X, part of the ongoing
Write Once/Test Everywere effort. (Credit Paul Brown)
* Fixed: Work around keep_alive bug in Net::HTTP.
(http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/10818)

1.1.1 (2007-05-16)
* Changed: Test case class names must end with Test, TestCase, Suite or
TestSuite.
* Changed: You can now run rake test:{foo,bar} to match against either foo or
bar (requires \{..\} on UNIX).
* Changed: JAVA_HOME now required on all platforms, along with more OS X
fixes. (Credit Paul Brown)
* Fixed: You can now run rake test:<name> from any directory, and it will find
just the right test cases.

1.1.0 (2007-05-13)
* Added: Proxy setting for downloading from remote repositories (use
repositories.proxy = ...).
* Added: projects task to list all the projects you can build.
* Added: Project attribute target to specify the target directory.
* Changed: The project and projects methods now accepts relative names when
called on a project. For example, project("foo").project("bar") finds the
sub-project "bar" in "foo".
* Changed: The project method now returns self if called on a method with no
name.
* Changed: The -warning flag (javac) is now set to true only when verbose.
* Changed: OpenJPA mapping now using Ant task instead of spawning another Java
instance.
* Changed: The test:name pattern translates to *name* so you can run tests by
package name, but only if you don't use * in the pattern.
* Changed: All projects are not evaluated when referenced (i.e. calling
project/projects) or before running any task. Project tasks do not exist until
a projet is evaluated.
* Removed: The projects method no longer accepts the :in argument, call
projects on a project instead.
* Fixed: Local directory tasks now work from any directory in the project.
* Fixed: Artifacts no longer created with timestamp from server.
* Fixed: Buildr no longer fails when run without tools.jar or JAVA_HOME
(OS X). (Credit Lyle Johnson)
* Fixed: Manifest gets EOL to keep EOF company. (Credit Tommy Knowlton)
* Fixed: Compile tasks clean after themselves when target directory changed.
(Credit Lyle Johnson)

1.0.0 (2007-05-04)
* Added: buildr:freeze and buildr:unfreeze task. These set the Rakefile to use
a particular version of Buildr, freezing by setting to the current version of
Buildr, unfreeze to use the latest Gem.
* Added: Buildr.options, with three options to start with: test, debug and
parallel.
* Added: Buildr.option.debug or environment variable DEBUG to control the
compiler debug option. Defaults to yes, except when doing a release.
* Changed: Buildr now fails nicely if JAVA_HOME not set.
* Changed: Migrated test cases to RSpec 0.9.
* Changed: Extended circular dependency check to multitask.
* Changed: JavaCC using RJB.
* Changed: OpenJPA 0.9.7 no longer snapshoted.
* Fixed: For Windows users: user's home directory, fu_check_options is now
rake_check_options, java command works around funky system bbug.

0.22 (2007-04-26)
* Added: Calling projects(:in=>foo) returns only the sub-projects defined in
foo.
* Added: _() as shortcut for path_to().
* Added: You can pass properties to java by setting the :properties options.
* Added: JUnit task has a way of setting options (options accessor and using
method), which for now supports passing properties to java.
* Added: You can now use the struct method to create a Struct for structoring
your multiple artifacts.
* Changed: Use rake artifacts to download all artifacts not already in the
local repository, and also download modified artifacts
(*cough*snapshots*cough*)
* Changed: Transport.download now uses timestamp on the destination file and
If-Modified-Since header to skip downloads of unmodified files.
* Changed: Downloading artifact sets the time stamp from the repository.
* Changed: Use buildr.rake in the project's directory and your home directory,
instead of buildr.rb.
* Changed: filter method accepts one argument, the source directory. Use
filter(src).into(target).
* Changed: Running Javac/Apt/Javadoc in process.
* Changed: Using Ant for OpenJPA enhancer and XMLBeans schema compiler.
* Changed: Jetty, JavaCC, OpenJPA and XMLBeans are no longer included by
default. You need to require them explicitly, e.g. require "buildr/jetty".
* Removed: Tasks no longer use a base directory, always map paths directly
using file, path_to or _().
* Fixed: The artifacts task no longer downloads POMs for artifacts created by
the Rakefile.

0.21 (2007-04-20)
* Added: Methods to read and write a file (shortcut for
File.read/File.open.write).
* Changed: Filter task now takes a source directory and target directory, and
copies all included (sans excluded) files between the two.
* Changed: Artifact type is now symbol instead of string (so :jar instead of
"jar"). You can still specify a string, but the return value from #to_spec or
#type is a symbol.
* Changed: Eclipse task now adds "src/main/resources", "src/test/java",
"src/test/resources" to build path, and excludes ".svn" and "CVS" directories
from being copied into target directories.
* Changed: The test task will now run JUnit test cases from classes ending
with Test or Suite. And the inclusion pattern is always set.
* Fixed: Project property not inherited if false.

0.20 (2007-04-18)
* Added: JavadocTask to generate Javadoc documentation for the project,
javadoc method on the project itself to return its javadoc task, and
Java.javadoc to do all the heavy lifting.
* Changed: Release code is now implemented as module instead of class. SVN
copy made from working copy instead of double commit.
* Removed: package :file_name options. Does not work with deployed artifacts
or POMs.
* Fixed: Packages not deployed in the right path (but POMs are).
* Fixed: JARs and WARs include redundant META-INF directory.
* Fixed: The local package task is now a dependency for install/deploy, and
build is dependency for package.

0.19 (2007-04-13)
* Fixed: Eclipse task correctly handles FileTasks
* Fixed: Eclipse task output directory is "target/classes"
(Project.compile.target) instead of "/target"
* Added: Set specific file permissions when uploading with SFTP transport with
:permission option
* Fixed: Correctly use JAVA_HOME environment variable, if available, for
determining java version
* Added: ConcatTask and concat: a file task that creates or updates the target
file by concatenating all the file prerequisites.
* Added: Ant module (requires antwrap and rjb Gems), so also added RJB setup
module.
* Added: When zipping you can include the contents of a directory using
:as=>".".
* Added: Convenience apt method returns a file task that generates sources
using APT.
* Added: Convenience open_jpa_enhance method to enhance compiled files.

console.
* Added: jetty:use to start Jetty inside the build or hook to an existing
server.

* Added: The local build task will now execute the local test task. So
building a project (or sub-project) will run the test cases on that project
(or sub-project) but not any of its dependencies.
* Added: ZipTask accepts nested path (i.e. calling path inside a path).
* Added: package(:war) by defaults picks libraries from the compiler
classpath. You can always override by passing the :libs option.
* Changed: Eclipse task now generates library path with M2_REPO variable or
project-relative paths where appropriate
* Changed: compile.target (CompileTask) and resources.target (Filter) are now
file tasks, not strings.  So passing the target to someone else will hopefully
convience them to invoke or enhance it.
* Changed: Java related tasks like OpenJPA, XMLBeans, JavaCC all moved to the
Buildr::Java module.
* Changed: Handling of package_as arguments to support JBI packaging.
* Changed: meta_inf project property is an array accepting filenames (strings)
and file tasks.
* Changed: meta_info by default only includes the LICENSE file from the
top-level project.
* Changed: The WarTask :classes argument is now a directory name, and will
include all files in this directory.
* Changed: WarTask and JarTask accept meta_inf argument.
* Changed: Behavior of needed? and prerequsities in base Rake::Task. This will
probably not affect you, but don't be surprised if it disappears (see
lib/core/rake_ext.rb for details).
* Changed: Were previous the test task would link to test.run, it now executes
the entire test lifecycle, and is the major point for extending the test
lifecycle.
* Changed: test.run is now test.junit.
* Changed: Ant.define is now Ant.declarative, Ant.execute is now
Ant.executable.
* Changed: The filter method now returns a Filter class that can be used to
set a filter, but is not itself a task. Instead, it creates a task when
setting its target.
* Changed: Project.resources now returns a ResourceTask that includes, but is
not itself a filter, accessed using the accessor filter.
* Changed: UnzipTask eliminated and replaced with Unzip which you now have to
run directly by calling extract.  However, unzip method creates a file task
and returns an Unzip object that can be used as a reference to that file
task.
* Changed: Attributes is now InheritedAttributes.
* Changed: The first call to package configures the package task from the
options, the second call only returns the package task.
* Removed: :cp argument, always use :classpath.
* Removed: src_dir, java_src_dir, target_dir, webapp_src_dir and all other
premature configuration attributes.
* Removed: Project tests method deprecated in favor of a single test method;
it now accepts an enhancement block, not an instance_eval block.
* Removed: FilterTask is dead.
* Removed: sub_projects method. Is anyone using this?
* Fixed: Local buildr.rb not loaded from running from inside a sub-project
directory.

JAR/WAR.
* Added: default manifest includes build-by, build-jdk and
implementation-title.
* Added: compile.from(sources) in the same vein as compile.with(classpath)
* Added: load all *.rake files form the tasks directory (if exists) for use
in
the main Rakefile.
* Added: Java.tools returns a reference to tools.jar on JDKs that include it.
* Added: brought back experimental test tasks.
* Added: artifacts task to download all artifacts referenced by project (using
either artifact or artifacts method).
* Changed: back to old behavior, compile task only executes if there are any
files to compile, and compile? method removed.
* Changed: repositories.remote is now an array instead of a hash, and
repositories are searched in the order in which they appear.
* Changed: release task is now a regular task, using the Release object
instead of being a ReleaseTask.
* Changed: eclipse task executes artifacts task.
* Fixed: inherited attributes now cache default value, useful when working
with arrays/hashes.
* Fixed: manifest file generated even if manifest attribute is false.
* Fixed: compile task now properly detects when not all files compiled.
* Fixed: bug that caused project file tasks to execute twice.

0.17 (2007-03-14)

creates a namespace relative to the root instead of the current namespace.
* Changed: a project definition is now a task definition.
* Changed: use enhance to extend the project definition instead of
after_define.
* Changed: LocalDirectoryTask replaced with Project.local_task.
* Changed: projects method accepts multiple names, returning only these
project definitions, returns all of them with no arguments.
* Changed: packge only defines the essentials once, so you can call package on
a project to retrieve a specific package by type/id.
* Changed: zip task (and jar/war) no longer resolve artifacts for you, must
call artifacts directly.
* Changed: cannot access a project before it's defined, but can do that with
sub-projects to establish dependencies.

* Added: zip.include :as=> to include file under specified name.
* Added: zip.merge to include the (expanded) contents of one zip file in
another.
