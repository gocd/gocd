= Rake 0.9.6 Released

Rake version 0.9.6 contains a number of fixes mainly for merging
Rake into the Ruby source tree and fixing tests.

== Changes

=== Bug Fixes (0.9.6)

* Better trace output when using a multi-threaded Rakefile.
* Arg parsing is now consistent for tasks and multitasks.
* Skip exit code test in versions of Ruby that don't support it well.

Changes for better integration with the Ruby source tree:

* Fix version literal for Ruby source tree build.
* Better loading of libraries for testing in Ruby build.
* Use the ruby version provided by Ruby's tests.

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:

Home Page:: http://github.com/jimweirich/rake
Download::  http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50
GitHub::    git://github.com/jimweirich/rake.git
