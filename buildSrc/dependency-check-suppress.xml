    Spring WebMVC 4.3.x does not appear to be affected by https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22060 based on review

    This is because in Spring 4.3 all of these log statements are at TRACE level, which are very unlikely to be enabled

    Time-limited suppression for https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29425. GoCD is not vulnerable as the use of
    FilenameUtils.normalize does not "use the result to construct a path value" as required by the defect. Neither does
    any of GoCD's libraries use this functionality.

    This was fixed in Commons IO 2.7 and GoCD originally upgraded to 2.11.0, however unfortunately all later versions
    have some regressions as noted in https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9397 https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/9517
    and https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9927

    While the last issue appears to be fixed by Commons IO 2.12 (not yet released) there are other regressions in 2.12
    master due to ongoing work and it feels the path to stability might take some time.
