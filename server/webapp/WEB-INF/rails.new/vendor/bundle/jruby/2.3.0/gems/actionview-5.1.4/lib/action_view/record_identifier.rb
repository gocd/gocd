module ActionView
  # RecordIdentifier encapsulates methods used by various ActionView helpers
  # to associate records with DOM elements.
  #
  # Consider for example the following code that form of post:
  #
  #   <%= form_for(post) do |f| %>
  #     <%= f.text_field :body %>
  #   <% end %>
  #
  # When +post+ is a new, unsaved ActiveRecord::Base instance, the resulting HTML
  # is:
  #
  #    <form class="new_post" id="new_post" action="/posts" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
  #      <input type="text" name="post[body]" id="post_body" />
  #    </form>
  #
  # When +post+ is a persisted ActiveRecord::Base instance, the resulting HTML
  # is:
  #
  #   <form class="edit_post" id="edit_post_42" action="/posts/42" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
  #     <input type="text" value="What a wonderful world!" name="post[body]" id="post_body" />
  #   </form>
  #
  # In both cases, the +id+ and +class+ of the wrapping DOM element are
  # automatically generated, following naming conventions encapsulated by the
  # RecordIdentifier methods #dom_id and #dom_class:
  #
  #   dom_id(Post.new)         # => "new_post"
  #   dom_class(Post.new)      # => "post"
  #   dom_id(Post.find 42)     # => "post_42"
  #   dom_class(Post.find 42)  # => "post"
  #
  # Note that these methods do not strictly require +Post+ to be a subclass of
  # ActiveRecord::Base.
  # Any +Post+ class will work as long as its instances respond to +to_key+
  # and +model_name+, given that +model_name+ responds to +param_key+.
  # For instance:
  #
  #   class Post
  #     attr_accessor :to_key
  #
  #     def model_name
  #       OpenStruct.new param_key: 'post'
  #     end
  #
  #     def self.find(id)
  #       new.tap { |post| post.to_key = [id] }
  #     end
  #   end

    # on the default implementation (which just joins all key attributes with '_') or on your own
    # overwritten version of the method. By default, this implementation passes the key string through a
    # method that replaces all characters that are invalid inside DOM ids, with valid ones. You need to
    # make sure yourself that your dom ids are valid, in case you overwrite this method.
