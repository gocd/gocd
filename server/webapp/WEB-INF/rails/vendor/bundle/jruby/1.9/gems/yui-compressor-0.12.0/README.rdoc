Ruby-YUI Compressor provides a Ruby interface to the {YUI Compressor Java library}[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/] for minifying JavaScript and CSS assets.

* {API documentation}[http://yui.rubyforge.org/]
* {Source code}[http://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-yui-compressor/]
* {Bug tracker}[http://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-yui-compressor/issues]

Tested on Mac OS X Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.2.

=== Installing and loading Ruby-YUI Compressor

Ruby-YUI Compressor is distributed as a Ruby Gem (<tt>yui-compressor</tt>). Because YUI Compressor's .jar file is included in the box, Java >= 1.4 is its only dependency.

  $ sudo gem install -r yui-compressor
  $ irb -rubygems
  >> require "yui/compressor"
  => true

You can also install Ruby-YUI Compressor with the {Rip package manager}[http://hellorip.com/]:

  $ rip install git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-yui-compressor.git 0.12.0
  $ irb -rrip
  >> require "yui/compressor"
  => true

=== Using Ruby-YUI Compressor

Create either a YUI::CssCompressor or a YUI::JavaScriptCompressor. Then pass an IO or string to the YUI::Compressor#compress method and get the compressed contents back as a string or have them yielded to a block.

==== Example: Compress JavaScript
  compressor = YUI::JavaScriptCompressor.new
  compressor.compress('(function () { var foo = {}; foo["bar"] = "baz"; })()')
  # => "(function(){var foo={};foo.bar=\"baz\"})();"

==== Example: Compress JavaScript and shorten local variable names
  compressor = YUI::JavaScriptCompressor.new(:munge => true)
  compressor.compress('(function () { var foo = {}; foo["bar"] = "baz"; })()')
  # => "(function(){var a={};a.bar=\"baz\"})();"

==== Example: Compress CSS
  compressor = YUI::CssCompressor.new
  compressor.compress(<<-END_CSS)
    div.error {
      color: red;
    }
    div.warning {
      display: none;
    }
  END_CSS
  # => "div.error{color:red;}div.warning{display:none;}"

==== Overriding the path to Java or the YUI Compressor .jar file

By default, YUI::Compressor looks for Java as the +java+ command in your path, and uses the YUI Compressor .jar file in YUI::Compressor's vendor directory. You can override both with the :java and :jar_file options:

  YUI::JavaScriptCompressor.new(
    :java     => "/usr/bin/java",
    :jar_file => "/path/to/my/yuicompressor-2.4.8.jar"
  )

==== Additional compression options

See the YUI::CssCompressor and YUI::JavaScriptCompressor documentation for more information on format-specific compression options.
