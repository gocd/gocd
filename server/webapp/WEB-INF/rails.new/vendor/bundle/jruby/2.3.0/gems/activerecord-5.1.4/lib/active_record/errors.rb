  # {ActiveRecord::Base.transaction}[rdoc-ref:Transactions::ClassMethods#transaction]
  # uses this exception to distinguish a deliberate rollback from other exceptional situations.
  # Normally, raising an exception will cause the
  # {.transaction}[rdoc-ref:Transactions::ClassMethods#transaction] method to rollback
  # the database transaction *and* pass on the exception. But if you raise an
  # ActiveRecord::Rollback exception, then the database transaction will be rolled back,
  # without passing on the exception.
  #
  # For example, you could do this in your controller to rollback a transaction:
  #
  #   class BooksController < ActionController::Base
  #     def create
  #       Book.transaction do
  #         book = Book.new(params[:book])
  #         book.save!
  #         if today_is_friday?
  #           # The system must fail on Friday so that our support department
  #           # won't be out of job. We silently rollback this transaction
  #           # without telling the user.
  #           raise ActiveRecord::Rollback, "Call tech support!"
  #         end
  #       end
  #       # ActiveRecord::Rollback is the only exception that won't be passed on
  #       # by ActiveRecord::Base.transaction, so this line will still be reached
  #       # even on Friday.
