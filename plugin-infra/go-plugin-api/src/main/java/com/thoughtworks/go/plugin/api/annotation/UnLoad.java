/**
 * Annotation that marks a method to be called when a plugin is unloaded.
 * <p>
 * Intended for use by plugin developers to mark a method of an
 * extension implementation to be called during plugin unload time.
 * </p>
 * The semantics of the method marked with this annotation is as follows.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>There should atmost one method in the implementation that should have this annotation.</li>
 *     <li>The method should be public, non-static.</li>
 *     <li>The method should take only one parameter- {@link com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.info.PluginContext}. Return values will be ignored.</li>
 *     <li>This annotation will not be inherited along with the method.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The framework performs the validation of the semantics mentioned above during the plugin load time - before executing the
 * method marked with {@link Load} annotation. But the callback to this method is only done during the plugin unload time.
 * <i>In summary, semantics checks are done at the plugin load and invocation done during the plugin unload.</i>
 *
 * Please refer to the Go Plugin documentation for more details.
