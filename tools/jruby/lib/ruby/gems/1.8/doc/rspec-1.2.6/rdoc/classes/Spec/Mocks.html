      <h2><a href="Mocks.html">Mocks</a> and Stubs</h2>
<p>
RSpec will create <a href="Mocks/Mock.html">Mock</a> Objects and Stubs for
you at runtime, or attach stub/mock behaviour to any of your real objects
(Partial <a href="Mocks/Mock.html">Mock</a>/Stub). Because the underlying
implementation for mocks and stubs is the same, you can intermingle mock
and stub behaviour in either dynamically generated mocks or your
pre-existing classes. There is a semantic difference in how they are
created, however, which can help clarify the role it is playing within a
given spec.
</p>
<h2><a href="Mocks/Mock.html">Mock</a> Objects</h2>
<p>
<a href="Mocks.html">Mocks</a> are objects that allow you to set and verify
expectations that they will receive specific messages during run time. They
are very useful for specifying how the subject of the spec interacts with
its collaborators. This approach is widely known as &quot;interaction
testing&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<a href="Mocks.html">Mocks</a> are also very powerful as a design tool. As
you are driving the implementation of a given class, <a
href="Mocks.html">Mocks</a> provide an anonymous collaborator that can
change in behaviour as quickly as you can write an expectation in your
spec. This flexibility allows you to design the interface of a collaborator
that often does not yet exist. As the shape of the class being specified
becomes more clear, so do the requirements for its collaborators - often
leading to the discovery of new types that are needed in your system.
</p>
<p>
Read <a
href="http://www.mockobjects.com/files/endotesting.pdf">Endo-Testing</a>
for a much more in depth description of this process.
</p>
<h2>Stubs</h2>
<p>
Stubs are objects that allow you to set &quot;stub&quot; responses to
messages. As Martin Fowler points out on his site, <a
href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mocks_arent_stubs</a>.
Paraphrasing Fowler&#8216;s paraphrasing of Gerard Meszaros: Stubs provide
canned responses to messages they might receive in a test, while mocks
allow you to specify and, subsquently, verify that certain messages should
be received during the execution of a test.
</p>
<h2>Partial <a href="Mocks.html">Mocks</a>/Stubs</h2>
<p>
RSpec also supports partial mocking/stubbing, allowing you to add stub/mock
behaviour to instances of your existing classes. This is generally
something to be avoided, because changes to the class can have ripple
effects on seemingly unrelated specs. When specs fail due to these ripple
effects, the fact that some methods are being mocked can make it difficult
to understand why a failure is occurring.
</p>
<p>
That said, partials do allow you to expect and verify interactions with
class methods such as +find+ and +create+ on <a href="Ruby.html">Ruby</a>
on Rails model classes.
</p>

<h2>Creating a <a href="Mocks/Mock.html">Mock</a></h2>
<p>
You can create a mock in any specification (or setup) using:
</p>
<pre>
  mock(name, options={})
</pre>
<p>
The optional <tt>options</tt> argument is a <tt>Hash</tt>. Currently the
only supported option is +:null_object+. Setting this to true instructs the
mock to ignore any messages it hasn’t been told to expect – and quietly
return itself. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  mock(&quot;person&quot;, :null_object =&gt; true)
</pre>
<h2>Creating a Stub</h2>
<p>
You can create a stub in any specification (or setup) using:
</p>
<pre>
  stub(name, stub_methods_and_values_hash)
</pre>
<p>
For example, if you wanted to create an object that always returns
&quot;More?!?!?!&quot; to &quot;please_sir_may_i_have_some_more&quot; you
would do this:
</p>
<pre>
  stub(&quot;Mr Sykes&quot;, :please_sir_may_i_have_some_more =&gt; &quot;More?!?!?!&quot;)
</pre>
<h2>Creating a Partial <a href="Mocks/Mock.html">Mock</a></h2>
<p>
You don&#8216;t really &quot;create&quot; a partial mock, you simply add
method stubs and/or mock expectations to existing classes and objects:
</p>
<pre>
  Factory.should_receive(:find).with(id).and_return(value)
  obj.stub!(:to_i).and_return(3)
  etc ...
</pre>
<h2>Expecting Messages</h2>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym)
  my_mock.should_not_receive(:sym)
</pre>
<h2>Expecting Arguments</h2>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(*args)
  my_mock.should_not_receive(:sym).with(*args)
</pre>
<h2>Argument <a href="Matchers.html">Matchers</a></h2>
<p>
Arguments that are passed to with are compared with actual arguments
received using == by default. In cases in which you want to specify things
about the arguments rather than the arguments themselves, you can use any
of RSpec&#8216;s Expression <a href="Matchers.html">Matchers</a>. They
don&#8216;t all make syntactic sense (they were primarily designed for use
with <a href="Expectations.html">Spec::Expectations</a>), but you are free
to create your own custom <a href="Matchers.html">Spec::Matchers</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="Mocks.html">Spec::Mocks</a> does provide one additional Matcher
method named ducktype.
</p>
<p>
In addition, <a href="Mocks.html">Spec::Mocks</a> adds some keyword Symbols
that you can use to specify certain kinds of arguments:
</p>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(no_args())
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(any_args())
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(1, kind_of(Numeric), &quot;b&quot;) #2nd argument can any kind of Numeric
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(1, boolean(), &quot;b&quot;) #2nd argument can true or false
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(1, /abc/, &quot;b&quot;) #2nd argument can be any String matching the submitted Regexp
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(1, anything(), &quot;b&quot;) #2nd argument can be anything at all
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).with(1, ducktype(:abs, :div), &quot;b&quot;)
                           #2nd argument can be object that responds to #abs and #div
</pre>
<h2>Receive Counts</h2>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).once
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).twice
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).exactly(n).times
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_least(:once)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_least(:twice)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_least(n).times
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_most(:once)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_most(:twice)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).at_most(n).times
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).any_number_of_times
</pre>
<h2>Ordering</h2>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).ordered
  my_mock.should_receive(:other_sym).ordered
    #This will fail if the messages are received out of order
</pre>
<h2>Setting Reponses</h2>
<p>
Whether you are setting a mock expectation or a simple stub, you can tell
the object precisely how to respond:
</p>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_return(value)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).exactly(3).times.and_return(value1, value2, value3)
    # returns value1 the first time, value2 the second, etc
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_return { ... } #returns value returned by the block
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_raise(error)
    #error can be an instantiated object or a class
    #if it is a class, it must be instantiable with no args
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_throw(:sym)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_yield(values,to,yield)
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
    # for methods that yield to a block multiple times
</pre>
<p>
Any of these responses can be applied to a stub as well, but stubs do not
support any qualifiers about the message received (i.e. you can&#8216;t
specify arguments or receive counts):
</p>
<pre>
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_return(value)
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_return(value1, value2, value3)
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_raise(error)
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_throw(:sym)
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_yield(values,to,yield)
  my_mock.stub!(:sym).and_yield(values,to,yield).and_yield(some,other,values,this,time)
</pre>
<h2>Arbitrary Handling</h2>
<p>
Once in a while you&#8216;ll find that the available expectations
don&#8216;t solve the particular problem you are trying to solve. Imagine
that you expect the message to come with an Array argument that has a
specific length, but you don&#8216;t care what is in it. You could do this:
</p>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:sym) do |arg|
    arg.should be_an_istance_of(Array)
    arg.length.should == 7
  end
</pre>
<p>
Note that this would fail if the number of arguments received was different
from the number of block arguments (in this case 1).
</p>
<h2>Combining Expectation Details</h2>
<p>
Combining the message name with specific arguments, receive counts and
responses you can get quite a bit of detail in your expectations:
</p>
<pre>
  my_mock.should_receive(:&lt;&lt;).with(&quot;illegal value&quot;).once.and_raise(ArgumentError)
</pre>
