Additions to the old CHANGES file were not made consistently so some
versions are missing from this file.  These changes are usually described in
the individual release notes files.

  no longer private methods in Object.  If you need to call 'task :xzy' inside
  your class, include Rake::DSL into the class.  The DSL is still available at
  the top level scope (via the top level object which extends Rake::DSL).

* Rake now warns when the deprecated :needs syntax used.

* Rake history is now UTF-8 encoded.

* Rake now uses case-insensitive comparisons to find the Rakefile on Windows.

  Baginski.

  current directory.  Patch by Alex Chaffee.

* Improved rakefile_location discovery on Windows.  Patch by James Tucker.

  Lüdtke

* Rake::RDocTask is deprecated.  Use RDoc::Task from RDoc 2.4.2+ (require

  (http://onestepback.org/redmine/issues/show/47)

  environment variable.

* Errors in Rake will now display the task invocation chain in effect
  at the time of the error.

* Accepted change by warnickr to not expand test patterns in shell
  (allowing more files in the test suite).

* Fixed that file tasks did not perform prereq lookups in scope
  (Redmine #57).

=== 0.8.7

* Fixed EXEEXT for JRuby on windows.

=== 0.8.6

* Minor fixes to the RDoc generation (removed dependency on darkfish
  and removed inline source option).

* Now allow # comments to comment a task definition.

=== 0.8.5

* Better support for the system command on Windows.

=== 0.8.4

* Preserve case when locating rakefiles (patch from James
  M. Lawrence/quix)

* Better support for windows paths in the test task (patch from Simon
  Chiang/bahuvrihi)

* Windows system dir search order is now: HOME, HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH,
  APPDATA, USERPROFILE (patch from Luis Lavena)

* MingGW is now recognized as a windows platform.  (patch from Luis
  Lavena)

* Numerous fixes to the windows test suite (patch from Luis Lavena).

  Test::Unit::Runner.

* Fixed default verbose mode (was accidently changed to false).

* Removed reference to manage_gem to fix the warning produced by the
  gem package task.

=== 0.8.3

* Enhanced the system directory detection in windows. We now check
  HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE if APPDATA isn't found. (Patch
  supplied by James Tucker). Rake no long aborts if it can't find the
  directory.

* Added fix to handle ruby installations in directories with spaces in
  their name.

=== 0.8.2

* Fixed bug in package task so that it will include the subdir
  directory in the package for testing. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

  attribute junk in a tar file. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Fixed filename dependency order bug in test_inspect_pending and
  test_to_s_pending. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Fixed check for file utils options to make them immune to the
  symbol/string differences. (Patch supplied by Edwin Pratomo)

* Fixed bug with rules involving multiple source (Patch supplied by
  Emanuel Indermühle)

* Switched from getoptlong to optparse (patches supplied by Edwin
  Pratomo)

  and freeze.

  task.

* Added the ability to reenable a task to be invoked a second time.

* Changed RDoc test task to have no default template. This makes it
  easier for the tempate to pick up the template from the environment.

* Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Evidently Mutex causes thread
  join errors when Ruby is compiled with -disable-pthreads. (Patch
  supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Fixed bug in makefile parser that had problems with extra spaces in
  file task names. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Added a performance patch for reading large makefile dependency
  files. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Default values for task arguments can easily be specified with the
  :with_defaults method. (Idea for default argument merging supplied
  by (Adam Q. Salter)

* The -T output will only self-truncate if the output is a tty.
  However, if RAKE_COLUMNS is explicitly set, it will be honored in
  any case. (Patch provided by Gavin Stark).

* Numerous fixes for running under windows. A big thanks to Bheeshmar
  Redheendran for spending a good part of the afternoon at the
  Lonestar Ruby Conference to help me work out these issues.

  silently skipping the functionl tests.
* Removed --usage and make -h the same as -H.

  from the FileUtil module.
* Added init and top_level for custom rake applications.

  Payton Quackenbush).

=== 0.7.1

* Added optional filter parameter to the --tasks command line option.
* Added flatten to allow rule transform procs to return lists of
  prereqs (Joel VanderWerf provided patch).
* Added pathmap to String and FileList.
* The -r option will now load .rake files (but a straight require
  doesn't yet).  NOTE: This is experimental ... it may be

* Fixed file creation bug in the unit tests (caused infinite loop on
  windows).
* Fixed bug where session based functional tests were run under
  windows.

  retrigger file tasks depending on the directory (see
  FileCreationTask and EarlyTime).
* Added egrep to FileList
* ruby command now runs same ruby version as rake.

* GemTask is now sensitive to the gem platform (Masao Mutoh).
* A non-existing file prerequisite will no longer cause an exception
  (Philipp Neubeck).

  messages.
* Make FileUtils methods private at the top level module to avoid
  accidental method leaking into other objects.
* Added test loader option to test task.  "testrb" is no longer the
  default test loader.  It is now eating syntax errors that should
  halt the unit tests.
* Revamped FileList so that it works more like and array (addressed
  flatten bug).  Added many tests around file list.
* Added +ext+ method to both String and FileList.

=== 0.5.0

  special actions on the result of the system call.  E.g.

    sh "shell_command" do |ok, res|
      puts "Program returned #{res.exitstatus}" if ! ok
    end

=== 0.4.9

* Switched to Jamis Buck's RDoc template.
* Removed autorequire from Rake's gem spec.  This prevents the Rake
  libraries from loading while using rails.

=== 0.4.8

* Added support for .rb versions of Rakefile.
* Removed \\\n's from test task.
* Fixed Ruby 1.9 compatibility issue with FileList.

=== 0.4.7

* Fixed problem in FileList that caused Ruby 1.9 to go into infinite
  recursion.  Since to_a was removed from Object, it does not need to
  added back into the list of methods to rewrite in FileList.  (Thanks
  to Kent Sibilev for pointing this out).

  using the built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no
  longer needed.

  macros.
* Allow a +test_files+ attribute in test tasks.  This allows more
  flexibility in specifying test files.

  until the first call that needs the file names.
* VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are
  treated like environment variables.  The values may be tested in a
  Rakefile by referencing ENV['VAR'].
* File.mtime is now used (instead of File.new().mtime).

=== 0.3.2.x
