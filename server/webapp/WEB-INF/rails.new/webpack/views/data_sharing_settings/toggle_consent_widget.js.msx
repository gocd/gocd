          This allows the calculation of the average number of pipelines a GoCD instance has. Knowing the average number
          of pipelines helps us optimize the GoCD experience.

          <span class="key">Number of agents (agent_count):</span>
          This allows the calculation of the average number of agents a GoCD instance has. This
          will help us ensure GoCD can handle a reasonable number of requests from the average number of agents.
        </div>
        <div class="consent-for">
          <span class="key">Oldest pipeline run time (oldest_pipeline_execution_time):</span>
          This provides data around the age of the GoCD instance.
          Along with the number of pipelines data point, it helps establish an expected growth in the number of pipelines.
          With performance related data which might be shared later (with your permission), this will help to see whether a GoCD instance becomes slower over time, as more pipelines and pipeline runs happen.
        </div>
        <div class="consent-for">
          <span class="key">GoCD version (gocd_version):</span>
          This provides us the version of GoCD the server is on.
        </div>
        <div class="consent-for">
          <span class="key">Server ID (server_id):</span>
          A randomly generated identifier to recognize unique instances of GoCD. This is different from the serverId attribute stored in GoCD's config.

        <div class="consent-for">
          <span class="key">Message version (message_version):</span>
