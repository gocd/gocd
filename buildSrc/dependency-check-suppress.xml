   Time-limited suppression for https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29425. GoCD is not vulnerable as the use of
   FilenameUtils.normalize does not "use the result to construct a path value" as required by the defect. Neither does
   any of GoCD's libraries use this functionality.

   This was fixed in Commons IO 2.7 and GoCD originally upgraded to 2.11.0, however unfortunately all later versions
   have some regressions as noted in https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9397 https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/9517
   and https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/9927

   While the last issue appears to be fixed by Commons IO 2.12 (not yet released) there are other regressions in 2.12
   master due to ongoing work and it feels the path to stability might take some time.
