 * <ul>
 *     <li>There should atmost one method in the implementation that should have this annotation.</li>
 *     <li>The method should be public, non-static.</li>
 *     <li>The method should take only one parameter- {@link com.thoughtworks.go.plugin.api.info.PluginContext}. Return values will be ignored.</li>
 *     <li>This annotation will not be inherited along with the method.</li>
 * </ul>
