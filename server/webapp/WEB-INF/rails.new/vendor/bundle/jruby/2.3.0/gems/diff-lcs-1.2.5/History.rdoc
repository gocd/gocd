== 1.2.5 / 2013-11-08

* Bugs fixed:
  * Comparing arrays flattened them too far, especially with Diff::LCS.sdiff.
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/pull/23

== 1.2.4 / 2013-04-20

* Bugs fixed:
  * A bug was introduced after 1.1.3 when pruning common sequences at the start
    of comparison. Paul Kunysch (@pck) fixed this in pull request 18. Thanks!
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/pull/18
* The Rubinius (1.9 mode) bug in rubinius/rubinius#2268 has been fixed by the
  Rubinius team two days after it was filed. Thanks for fixing this so quickly!
  https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues/2268
* Switching to Raggi's hoe-gemspec2 for gemspec generation.

== 1.2.3 / 2013-04-11

* Bugs Fixed:
  * The new encoding detection for diff output generation (added in 1.2.2)
    introduced a bug if the left side of the comparison was the empty set.
    Originally found in rspec/rspec-expectations#238 and
    rspec/rspec-expectations#239. Jon Rowe developed a reasonable heuristic
    (left side, right side, empty string literal) to avoid this bug.
    https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/pull/238
    https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/pull/239
* There is a known issue with Rubinius in 1.9 mode reported in
  rubinius/rubinius#2268 and demonstrated in the Travis CI builds. For all
  other tested platforms, diff-lcs is considered stable. As soon as a suitably
  small test-case can be created for the Rubinius team to examine, this will be
  added to the Rubinius issue around this.

== 1.2.2 / 2013-03-30

* Bugs Fixed:
  * Diff::LCS::Hunk could not properly generate a difference for comparison
    sets that are not US-ASCII-compatible because of the use of literal regular
    expressions and strings. Jon Rowe (JonRowe) found this in
    rspec/rspec-expectations#219 and provided a first pass implementation in
    diff-lcs#15. I've reworked it because of test failures in Rubinius when
    running in Ruby 1.9 mode. This coerces the added values to the encoding of
    the old dataset (as determined by the first piece of the old dataset).
    https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/issues/219
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/pull/15
* Adding Travis CI testing for Ruby 2.0.

== 1.2.1 / 2013-02-09

* Bugs Fixed:
  * As seen in https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/pull/200, the
    release of Diff::LCS 1.2 introduced an unnecessary public API change to
    Diff::LCS::Hunk (see the change at
    https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/commit/3d6fc82c for details).
    The new method name (and behaviour) is more correct, but I should not have
    renamed the function or should have at least provided an alias. This
    release restores Diff::LCS::Hunk#unshift as an alias to
    #merge. Note that the old #unshift behaviour was incorrect and will not be
    restored.

== 1.2.0 / 2013-01-21
* Minor Enhancements:
  * Added special case handling for Diff::LCS.patch so that it handles patches
    that are empty or contain no changes.
  * Added two new methods (#patch\_me and #unpatch\_me) to the includable
    module.
* Bugs Fixed:
  * Fixed issue #1 patch direction detection.
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/1
  * Resolved issue #2 by handling string[string.size, 1] properly (it returns
    "" not nil). https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/2
  * Michael Granger (ged) fixed an implementation error in Diff::LCS::Change
    and added specs in pull request #8. Thanks!
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/8
  * Made the code auto-testable.
  * Vít Ondruch (voxik) provided the latest version of the GPL2 license file in
    pull request #10. Thanks! https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/10
  * Fixed a documentation issue with the includable versions of #patch! and
    #unpatch! where they implied that they would replace the original value.
    Given that Diff::LCS.patch always returns a copy, the documentation was
    incorrect and has been corrected. To provide the behaviour that was
    originally documented, two new methods were added to provide this
    behaviour. Found by scooter-dangle in issue #12. Thanks!
    https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/12
* Code Style Changes:
  * Removed trailing spaces.
  * Calling class methods using '.' instead of '::'.
  * Vít Ondruch (voxik) removed unnecessary shebangs in pull request #9.
    Thanks! https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/9
  * Kenichi Kamiya (kachick) removed some warnings of an unused variable in
    lucky pull request #13. https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/13
    Thanks!
  * Embarked on a major refactoring to make the files a little more manageable
    and understand the code on a deeper level.
  * Adding to http://travis-ci.org.

== 1.1.3 / 2011-08-27
* Converted to 'hoe' for release.
* Converted tests to RSpec 2.
* Extracted the body of htmldiff into a class available from
  diff/lcs/htmldiff.
* Migrated development and issue tracking to GitHub.
* Bugs fixed:
  - Eliminated the explicit use of RubyGems in both bin/htmldiff and bin/ldiff.
    Resolves issue 4 (https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/4).
  - Eliminated Ruby warnings. Resolves issue 3
    (https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs/issues/3).

== 1.1.2 / 2004-10-20
* Fixed a problem reported by Mauricio Fernandez in htmldiff.

== 1.1.1 / 2004-09-25
* Fixed bug #891:
  http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?func=detail&atid=407&aid=891&group_id=84
* Fixed a problem with callback initialisation code (it assumed that all
  callbacks passed as classes can be initialised; now, it rescues
  NoMethodError in the event of private :new being called).
* Modified the non-initialisable callbacks to have a private #new method.
* Moved ldiff core code to Diff::LCS::Ldiff (diff/lcs/ldiff.rb).

== 1.1.0 / -
* Eliminated the need for Diff::LCS::Event and removed it.
* Added a contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallback.
* Implemented patching/unpatching for standard Diff callback output formats
  with both #diff and #sdiff.
* Extensive documentation changes.

== 1.0.4 / -
* Fixed a problem with bin/ldiff output, especially for unified format.
  Newlines that should have been present weren't.
* Changed the .tar.gz installer to generate Windows batch files if ones do not
  exist already. Removed the existing batch files as they didn't work.

== 1.0.3 / -
* Fixed a problem with #traverse\_sequences where the first difference from the
  left sequence might not be appropriately captured.

== 1.0.2 / -
* Fixed an issue with ldiff not working because actions were changed from
  symbols to strings.

== 1.0.1 / -
* Minor modifications to the gemspec, the README.
* Renamed the diff program to ldiff (as well as the companion batch file) so as
  to not collide with the standard diff program.
* Fixed issues with RubyGems. Requires RubyGems > 0.6.1 or >= 0.6.1 with the
  latest CVS version.

== 1.0 / -
* Initial release based mostly on Perl's Algorithm::Diff.
