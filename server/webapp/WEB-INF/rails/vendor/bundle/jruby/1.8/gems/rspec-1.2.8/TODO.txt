== Refactoring

** global predictate matchers should be stored in run_options
* eliminate dependency on global options and configuration
** the only place they should exist is in the Runner, which should manage them

== Future

* do SOMETHING with the website
* separate the underlying framework from the DSL
  * be able to do everything with classes and methods
* tweak raise_error rdoc to show only one arg

== rspec-2.0

* rename top level namespace to Rspec and commands to 'rspec' and 'autorspec'
  * continue to support Spec 'spec' and 'autospec' as aliases for a reasonable time
