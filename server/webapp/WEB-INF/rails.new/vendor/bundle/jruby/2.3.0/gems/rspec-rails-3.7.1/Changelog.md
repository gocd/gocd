Breaking Changes for 3.0.0:

* Extracts the `mock_model` and `stub_model` methods to the
  `rspec-activemodel-mocks` gem. (Thomas Holmes)
* Spec types are no longer inferred by location, they instead need to be

  in the default generated `spec_helper.rb`. (Xavier Shay, Myron Marston)
* `controller` macro in controller specs no longer mutates
  `:described_class` metadata. It still overrides the subject and sets
  the controller, though. (Myron Marston)
* Stop depending on or requiring `rspec-collection_matchers`. Users who
  want those matchers should add the gem to their Gemfile and require it
  themselves. (Myron Marston)
* Removes runtime dependency on `ActiveModel`. (Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas)

* Supports Rails 4.x reference attribute ids in generated scaffold for view
  specs. (Giovanni Cappellotto)

* Switch to parsing params with `Rack::Utils::parse_nested_query` to match Rails.
  (Tim Watson)
* Fix incorrect namespacing of anonymous controller routes. (Aaron Kromer)

* Removes the `--webrat` option for the request spec generator (Andy Lindeman)

  enabled by default. (Thomas Holmes)

Deprecations

  `rspec-activemodel-mocks` gem. (Thomas Holmes)
* Issue a deprecation to instruct users to configure
  `config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!` during the
  upgrade process since spec type inference is opt-in in 3.0.
  (Jon Rowe)
* Issue a deprecation when `described_class` is accessed in a controller
  example group that has used the `controller { }` macro to generate an
  anonymous controller class, since in 2.x, `described_class` would
  return that generated class but in 3.0 it will continue returning the
  class passed to `describe`. (Myron Marston)

Capybara-2.0 integration support:

* include RailsExampleGroup in spec/features (necessary when there is no AR)
* include Capybara::DSL and Capybara::RSpecMatchers in spec/features

See [https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/pull/809](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/pull/809)
and [http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/file/Capybara.md](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/file/Capybara.md)
for background.

2.11.1, .2, .3 were yanked due to errant documentation.

### 2.11.0 / 2012-07-07
[Full Changelog](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/compare/v2.10.1...v2.11.0)

Enhancements

* The generated `spec/spec_helper.rb` sets `config.order = "random"` so that
  specs run in random order by default.
* rename `render_template` to `have_rendered` (and alias to `render_template`
  for backward compatibility)
* The controller spec generated with `rails generate scaffold namespaced::model`
  matches the spec generated with `rails generate scaffold namespaced/model`
  (Kohei Hasegawa)

Bug fixes

* "uninitialized constant" errors are avoided when using using gems like
  `rspec-rails-uncommitted` that define `Rspec::Rails` before `rspec-rails`
  loads (Andy Lindeman)
