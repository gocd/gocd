  #
  # ==== Async
  #
  # Yes: The Queue Adapter has the ability to run the job in a non-blocking manner.
  # It either runs on a separate or forked process, or on a different thread.
  #
  # No: The job is run in the same process.
  #
  # ==== Queues
  #
  # Yes: Jobs may set which queue they are run in with queue_as or by using the set
  # method.
  #
  # ==== Delayed
  #
  # Yes: The adapter will run the job in the future through perform_later.
  #
  # (Gem): An additional gem is required to use perform_later with this adapter.
  #
  # No: The adapter will run jobs at the next opportunity and cannot use perform_later.
  #
  # N/A: The adapter does not support queueing.
  #
  # NOTE:
  # queue_classic supports job scheduling since version 3.1.
  # For older versions you can use the queue_classic-later gem.
  #
  # ==== Priorities
  #
  # The order in which jobs are processed can be configured differently depending
  # on the adapter.
  #
  # Job: Any class inheriting from the adapter may set the priority on the job
  # object relative to other jobs.
  #
  # Queue: The adapter can set the priority for job queues, when setting a queue
  # with Active Job this will be respected.
  #
  # Yes: Allows the priority to be set on the job object, at the queue level or
  # as default configuration option.
  #
  # No: Does not allow the priority of jobs to be configured.
  #
  # N/A: The adapter does not support queueing, and therefore sorting them.
  #
  # ==== Timeout
  #
  # When a job will stop after the allotted time.
  #
  # Job: The timeout can be set for each instance of the job class.
  #
  # Queue: The timeout is set for all jobs on the queue.
  #
  # Global: The adapter is configured that all jobs have a maximum run time.
  #
  # N/A: This adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore timeout
  # is unsupported.
  #
  # ==== Retries
  #
  # Job: The number of retries can be set per instance of the job class.
  #
  # Yes: The Number of retries can be configured globally, for each instance or
  # on the queue. This adapter may also present failed instances of the job class
  # that can be restarted.
  #
  # Global: The adapter has a global number of retries.
  #
  # N/A: The adapter does not run in a separate process, and therefore doesn't
  # support retries.
  #
  # === Async and Inline Queue Adapters
  #
  # Active Job has two built-in queue adapters intended for development and
  # testing: +:async+ and +:inline+.
