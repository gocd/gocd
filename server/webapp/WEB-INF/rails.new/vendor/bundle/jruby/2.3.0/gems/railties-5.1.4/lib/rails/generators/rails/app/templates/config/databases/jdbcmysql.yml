# MySQL. Versions 5.1.10 and up are supported.

  adapter: mysql
  pool: <%%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
  username: root

  host: localhost

development:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= app_name %>_development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= app_name %>_test

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: <%= app_name %>_production
  username: <%= app_name %>
  password: <%%= ENV['<%= app_name.upcase %>_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
