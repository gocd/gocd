== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, checkout the 
full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running by hand

If you only want to run a single test suite, or don't want to bother with Rake,
you can do so with something like:

   ruby controller/base_tests.rb

== Dependency on ActiveRecord and database setup

Test cases in the test/controller/active_record/ directory depend on having
activerecord and sqlite installed. If ActiveRecord is not in 
actionpack/../activerecord directory, or the sqlite rubygem is not installed,
these tests are skipped.

Other tests are runnable from a fresh copy of actionpack without any configuration.
