.TH tt 1 2013-06-19 Treetop "Treetop v1.4.14"
.SH NAME
tt \- Compile a treetop grammar file to ruby source code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tt
.RI [ options "] " grammar_file "[.treetop|.tt] ..."

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tt
program is a command-line script to compile .treetop files into Ruby
source code.

The
.B tt
program takes a list of files with a .treetop extension and compiles
them into .rb files of the same name. You can then require these files
like any other Ruby script.

Alternately, you can supply just one .treetop file and a \-o flag to
specify the name of the output file.

Note: while treetop grammar files
.B must
have a supported filename extensions, (.treetop or .tt), the extension
name is not required when calling the compiler with grammar file
names.
