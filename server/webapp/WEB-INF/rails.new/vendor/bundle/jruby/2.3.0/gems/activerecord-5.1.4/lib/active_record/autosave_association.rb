module ActiveRecord
  # = Active Record Autosave Association
  #
  # AutosaveAssociation is a module that takes care of automatically saving
  # associated records when their parent is saved. In addition to saving, it
  # also destroys any associated records that were marked for destruction.
  # (See #mark_for_destruction and #marked_for_destruction?).
  #
  # Saving of the parent, its associations, and the destruction of marked
  # associations, all happen inside a transaction. This should never leave the
  # database in an inconsistent state.
  #
  # If validations for any of the associations fail, their error messages will
  # be applied to the parent.
  #
  # Note that it also means that associations marked for destruction won't
  # be destroyed directly. They will however still be marked for destruction.
  #
  # Note that <tt>autosave: false</tt> is not same as not declaring <tt>:autosave</tt>.
  # When the <tt>:autosave</tt> option is not present then new association records are
  # saved but the updated association records are not saved.
  #
  # == Validation
  #
  # Child records are validated unless <tt>:validate</tt> is +false+.
  #
  # == Callbacks
  #
  # Association with autosave option defines several callbacks on your
  # model (before_save, after_create, after_update). Please note that
  # callbacks are executed in the order they were defined in
  # model. You should avoid modifying the association content, before
  # autosave callbacks are executed. Placing your callbacks after
  # associations is usually a good practice.
  #
  # === One-to-one Example
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_one :author, autosave: true
  #   end
  #
  # Saving changes to the parent and its associated model can now be performed
  # automatically _and_ atomically:
  #
  #   post = Post.find(1)
  #   post.title       # => "The current global position of migrating ducks"
  #   post.author.name # => "alloy"
  #
  #   post.title = "On the migration of ducks"
  #   post.author.name = "Eloy Duran"
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload
  #   post.title       # => "On the migration of ducks"
  #   post.author.name # => "Eloy Duran"
  #
  # Destroying an associated model, as part of the parent's save action, is as
  # simple as marking it for destruction:
  #
  #   post.author.mark_for_destruction
  #   post.author.marked_for_destruction? # => true
  #
  # Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
  #
  #   id = post.author.id
  #   Author.find_by(id: id).nil? # => false
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload.author # => nil
  #
  # Now it _is_ removed from the database:
  #
  #   Author.find_by(id: id).nil? # => true
  #
  # === One-to-many Example
  #
  # When <tt>:autosave</tt> is not declared new children are saved when their parent is saved:
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :comments # :autosave option is not declared
  #   end
  #
  #   post = Post.new(title: 'ruby rocks')
  #   post.comments.build(body: 'hello world')
  #   post.save # => saves both post and comment
  #
  #   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
  #   post.comments.build(body: 'hello world')
  #   post.save # => saves both post and comment
  #
  #   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
  #   post.comments.create(body: 'hello world')
  #   post.save # => saves both post and comment
  #
  # When <tt>:autosave</tt> is true all children are saved, no matter whether they
  # are new records or not:
  #
  #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     has_many :comments, autosave: true
  #   end
  #
  #   post = Post.create(title: 'ruby rocks')
  #   post.comments.create(body: 'hello world')
  #   post.comments[0].body = 'hi everyone'
  #   post.comments.build(body: "good morning.")
  #   post.title += "!"
  #   post.save # => saves both post and comments.
  #
  # Destroying one of the associated models as part of the parent's save action
  # is as simple as marking it for destruction:
  #
  #   post.comments # => [#<Comment id: 1, ...>, #<Comment id: 2, ...]>
  #   post.comments[1].mark_for_destruction
  #   post.comments[1].marked_for_destruction? # => true
  #   post.comments.length # => 2
  #
  # Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:
  #
  #   id = post.comments.last.id
  #   Comment.find_by(id: id).nil? # => false
  #
  #   post.save
  #   post.reload.comments.length # => 1
  #
  # Now it _is_ removed from the database:
  #
  #   Comment.find_by(id: id).nil? # => true
