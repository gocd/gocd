Description:
    Stubs out new asset placeholders. Pass the asset name, either CamelCased
    or under_scored.

    To create an asset within a folder, specify the asset's name as a
    path like 'parent/name'.

    This generates a JavaScript stub in app/assets/javascripts and a stylesheet
    stub in app/assets/stylesheets.

    If CoffeeScript is available, JavaScripts will be generated with the .coffee extension.
    If Sass 3 is available, stylesheets will be generated with the .scss extension.

Example:
    `rails generate assets posts`

    Posts assets.
        JavaScript:     app/assets/javascripts/posts.js
        Stylesheet:     app/assets/stylesheets/posts.css
