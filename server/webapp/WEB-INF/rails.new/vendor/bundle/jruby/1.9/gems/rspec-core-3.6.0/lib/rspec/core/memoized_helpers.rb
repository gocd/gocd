    # available to be called from within example blocks.

    # @see ClassMethods
    module MemoizedHelpers
      # @note `subject` was contributed by Joe Ferris to support the one-liner
      #   syntax embraced by shoulda matchers:
      #
      #       describe Widget do
      #         it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
      #         # or
      #         it { should validate_presence_of(:name) }
      #       end
      #
      #   While the examples below demonstrate how to use `subject`
      #   explicitly in examples, we recommend that you define a method with
      #   an intention revealing name instead.
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   # Explicit declaration of subject.
      #   describe Person do
      #     subject { Person.new(:birthdate => 19.years.ago) }
      #     it "should be eligible to vote" do
      #       subject.should be_eligible_to_vote
      #       # ^ ^ explicit reference to subject not recommended
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      #   # Implicit subject => { Person.new }.
      #   describe Person do
      #     it "should be eligible to vote" do
      #       subject.should be_eligible_to_vote
      #       # ^ ^ explicit reference to subject not recommended
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      #   # One-liner syntax - expectation is set on the subject.
      #   describe Person do
      #     it { is_expected.to be_eligible_to_vote }
      #     # or
      #     it { should be_eligible_to_vote }
      #   end
      #
      # @note Because `subject` is designed to create state that is reset
      #   between each example, and `before(:context)` is designed to setup
      #   state that is shared across _all_ examples in an example group,
      #   `subject` is _not_ intended to be used in a `before(:context)` hook.
      #
      # @see #should
      # @see #should_not
      # @see #is_expected

          Class === described ? described.new : described
        end
      end

      # When `should` is called with no explicit receiver, the call is
      # delegated to the object returned by `subject`. Combined with an
      # implicit subject this supports very concise expressions.
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   describe Person do
      #     it { should be_eligible_to_vote }

      #
      # @see #subject
      # @see #is_expected
      #
      # @note This only works if you are using rspec-expectations.
      # @note If you are using RSpec's newer expect-based syntax you may
      #       want to use `is_expected.to` instead of `should`.
