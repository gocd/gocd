      <h1>Rakefile Format (as of version 0.8.3)</h1>
<p>
First of all, there is no special format for a Rakefile. A Rakefile
contains executable Ruby code. Anything legal in a ruby script is allowed
in a Rakefile.
</p>
<p>
Now that we understand there is no special syntax in a Rakefile, there are
some conventions that are used in a Rakefile that are a little unusual in a
typical Ruby program. Since a Rakefile is tailored to specifying tasks and
actions, the idioms used in a Rakefile are designed to support that.
</p>
<p>
So, what goes into a Rakefile?
</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
Tasks are the main unit of work in a Rakefile. Tasks have a name (usually
given as a symbol or a string), a list of prerequisites (more symbols or
strings) and a list of actions (given as a block).
</p>
<h3>Simple Tasks</h3>
<p>
A task is declared by using the <tt>task</tt> method. <tt>task</tt> takes a
single parameter that is the name of the task.
</p>
<pre>
  task :name
</pre>
<h3>Tasks with Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
Any prerequisites are given as a list (inclosed in square brackets)
following the name and an arrow (=&gt;).
</p>
<pre>
  task :name =&gt; [:prereq1, :prereq2]
</pre>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Although this syntax looks a little funky, it is legal Ruby.
We are constructing a hash where the key is :name and the value for that
key is the list of prerequisites. It is equivalent to the following &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  hash = Hash.new
  hash[:name] = [:prereq1, :prereq2]
  task(hash)
</pre>
<h3>Tasks with Actions</h3>
<p>
Actions are defined by passing a block to the <tt>task</tt> method. Any
Ruby code can be placed in the block. The block may reference the task
object via the block paramter..
</p>
<pre>
  task :name =&gt; [:prereq1, :prereq2] do |t|
    # actions (may reference t)
  end
</pre>
<h3>Multiple Definitions</h3>
<p>
A task may be specified more than once. Each specification adds its
prerequisites and actions to the existing definition. This allows one part
of a rakefile to specify the actions and a different rakefile (perhaps
separately generated) to specify the dependencies.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following is equivalent to the single task specification
given above.
</p>
<pre>
  task :name
  task :name =&gt; [:prereq1]
  task :name =&gt; [:prereq2]
  task :name do |t|
    # actions
  end
</pre>
<h2>File Tasks</h2>
<p>
Some tasks are designed to create a file from one or more other files.
Tasks that generate these files may be skipped if the file already exists.
File tasks are used to specify file creation tasks.
</p>
<p>
File tasks are declared using the <tt>file</tt> method (instead of the
<tt>task</tt> method). In addition, file tasks are usually named with a
string rather than a symbol.
</p>
<p>
The following file task creates a executable program (named <tt>prog</tt>)
given two object files name <tt>a.o</tt> and <tt>b.o</tt>. The tasks for
creating <tt>a.o</tt> and <tt>b.o</tt> are not shown.
</p>
<pre>
  file &quot;prog&quot; =&gt; [&quot;a.o&quot;, &quot;b.o&quot;] do |t|
    sh &quot;cc -o #{t.name} #{t.prerequisites.join(' ')}&quot;
  end
</pre>
<h2>Directory Tasks</h2>
<p>
It is common to need to create directories upon demand. The
<tt>directory</tt> convenience method is a short-hand for creating a
FileTask that creates the directory. For example, the following declaration
&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  directory &quot;testdata/examples/doc&quot;
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  file &quot;testdata&quot;              do |t| mkdir t.name end
  file &quot;testdata/examples&quot;     do |t| mkdir t.name end
  file &quot;testdata/examples/doc&quot; do |t| mkdir t.name end
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>directory</tt> method does not accept prerequisites or actions, but
both prerequisites and actions can be added later. For example &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  directory &quot;testdata&quot;
  file &quot;testdata&quot; =&gt; [&quot;otherdata&quot;]
  file &quot;testdata&quot; do
    cp Dir[&quot;standard_data/*.data&quot;], &quot;testdata&quot;
  end
</pre>
<h2>Tasks with Parallel Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
Rake allows parallel execution of prerequisites using the following syntax:
</p>
<pre>
  multitask :copy_files =&gt; [:copy_src, :copy_doc, :copy_bin] do
    puts &quot;All Copies Complete&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
In this example, <tt>copy_files</tt> is a normal rake task. Its actions are
executed whereever all of its prerequisites are done. The big difference is
that the prerequisites (<tt>copy_src</tt>, <tt>copy_bin</tt> and
<tt>copy_doc</tt>) are executed in parallel. Each of the prerequisites are
run in their own Ruby thread, possibly allowing faster overall runtime.
</p>
<h3>Secondary Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
If any of the primary prerequites of a multitask have common secondary
prerequisites, all of the primary/parallel prerequisites will wait until
the common prerequisites have been run.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the <tt>copy_<em>xxx</em></tt> tasks have the following
prerequisites:
</p>
<pre>
  task :copy_src =&gt; [:prep_for_copy]
  task :copy_bin =&gt; [:prep_for_copy]
  task :copy_doc =&gt; [:prep_for_copy]
</pre>
<p>
Then the <tt>prep_for_copy</tt> task is run before starting all the copies
in parallel. Once <tt>prep_for_copy</tt> is complete, <tt>copy_src</tt>,
<tt>copy_bin</tt>, and <tt>copy_doc</tt> are all run in parallel. Note that
<tt>prep_for_copy</tt> is run only once, even though it is referenced in
multiple threads.
</p>
<h3>Thread Safety</h3>
<p>
The Rake internal data structures are thread-safe with respect to the
multitask parallel execution, so there is no need for the user to do extra
synchronization for Rake&#8216;s benefit. However, if there are user data
structures shared between the parallel prerequisites, the user must do
whatever is necessary to prevent race conditions.
</p>
<h2>Tasks with Arguments</h2>
<p>
Prior to version 0.8.0, rake was only able to handle command line arguments
of the form NAME=VALUE that were passed into Rake via the ENV hash. Many
folks had asked for some kind of simple command line arguments, perhaps
using &quot;&#8212;&quot; to separate regular task names from argument
values on the command line. The problem is that there was no easy way to
associate positional arguments on the command line with different tasks.
Suppose both tasks :a and :b expect a command line argument: does the first
value go with :a? What if :b is run first? Should it then get the first
command line argument.
</p>
<p>
Rake 0.8.0 solves this problem by explicitly passing values directly to the
tasks that need them. For example, if I had a release task that required a
version number, I could say:
</p>
<pre>
   rake release[0.8.2]
</pre>
<p>
And the string &quot;0.8.2&quot; will be passed to the :release task.
Multiple arguments can be passed by separating them with a comma, for
example:
</p>
<pre>
   rake name[john,doe]
</pre>
<p>
Just a few words of caution. The rake task name and its arguments need to
be a single command line argument to rake. This generally means no spaces.
If spaces are needed, then the entire rake + argument string should be
quoted. Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
   rake &quot;name[billy bob, smith]&quot;
</pre>
<p>
(Quoting rules vary between operating systems and shells, so make sure you
consult the proper docs for your OS/shell).
</p>
<h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters</h3>
<p>
Parameters are only given to tasks that are setup to expect them. In order
to handle named parameters, the task declaration syntax for tasks has been
extended slightly.
</p>
<p>
For example, a task that needs a first name and last name might be declared
as:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, [:first_name, :last_name]
</pre>
<p>
The first argument is still the name of the task (:name in this case). The
next to argumements are the names of the parameters expected by :name in an
array (:first_name and :last_name in the example).
</p>
<p>
To access the values of the paramters, the block defining the task
behaviour can now accept a second parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, [:first_name, :last_name] do |t, args|
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<p>
The first argument of the block &quot;t&quot; is always bound to the
current task object. The second argument &quot;args&quot; is an open-struct
like object that allows access to the task arguments. Extra command line
arguments to a task are ignored. Missing command line arguments are given
the nil value.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to specify default values for the arguments, you can use the
with_defaults method in the task body. Here is the above example where we
specify default values for the first and last names:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, [:first_name, :last_name] do |t, args|
     args.with_defaults(:first_name =&gt; &quot;John&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Dough&quot;)
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<h3>Tasks that Expect Parameters and Have Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
Tasks that use parameters have a slightly different format for
prerequisites. Use the arrow notation to indicate the prerequisites for
tasks with arguments. For example:
</p>
<pre>
   task :name, [:first_name, :last_name] =&gt; [:pre_name] do |t, args|
     args.with_defaults(:first_name =&gt; &quot;John&quot;, :last_name =&gt; &quot;Dough&quot;)
     puts &quot;First name is #{args.first_name}&quot;
     puts &quot;Last  name is #{args.last_name}&quot;
   end
</pre>
<h3>Deprecated Task Parameters Format</h3>
<p>
There is an older format for declaring task parameters that omitted the
task argument array and used the :needs keyword to introduce the
dependencies. That format is still supported for compatibility, but is not
recommended for use.
</p>
<h2>Accessing Task Programatically</h2>
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to manipulate tasks programatically in a Rakefile.
To find a task object, use the <tt>:[]</tt> operator on the <tt><a
href="../../classes/Rake/Task.html">Rake::Task</a></tt>.
</p>
<h3>Programmatic Task Example</h3>
<p>
For example, the following Rakefile defines two tasks. The :doit task
simply prints a simple &quot;DONE&quot; message. The :dont class will
lookup the doit class and remove (clear) all of its prerequisites and
actions.
</p>
<pre>
   task :doit do
     puts &quot;DONE&quot;
   end

   task :dont do
     Rake::Task[:doit].clear
   end
</pre>
<p>
Running this example:
</p>
<pre>
  $ rake doit
  (in /Users/jim/working/git/rake/x)
  DONE
  $ rake dont doit
  (in /Users/jim/working/git/rake/x)
  $
</pre>
<p>
The ability to programmatically manipulate tasks gives rake very powerful
meta-programming capabilities w.r.t. task execution, but should be used
with cation.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
When a file is named as a prerequisite, but does not have a file task
defined for it, Rake will attempt to synthesize a task by looking at a list
of rules supplied in the Rakefile.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we were trying to invoke task &quot;mycode.o&quot;, but no task is
defined for it. But the rakefile has a rule that look like this &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  rule '.o' =&gt; ['.c'] do |t|
    sh &quot;cc #{t.source} -c -o #{t.name}&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
This rule will synthesize any task that ends in &quot;.o&quot;. It has a
prerequisite a source file with an extension of &quot;.c&quot; must exist.
If Rake is able to find a file named &quot;mycode.c&quot;, it will
automatically create a task that builds &quot;mycode.o&quot; from
&quot;mycode.c&quot;.
</p>
<p>
If the file &quot;mycode.c&quot; does not exist, rake will attempt to
recursively synthesize a rule for it.
</p>
<p>
When a task is synthesized from a rule, the <tt>source</tt> attribute of
the task is set to the matching source file. This allows us to write rules
with actions that reference the source file.
</p>
<h3>Advanced Rules</h3>
<p>
Any regular expression may be used as the rule pattern. Additionally, a
proc may be used to calculate the name of the source file. This allows for
complex patterns and sources.
</p>
<p>
The following rule is equivalent to the example above.
</p>
<pre>
  rule( /\.o$/ =&gt; [
    proc {|task_name| task_name.sub(/\.[^.]+$/, '.c') }
  ]) do |t|
    sh &quot;cc #{t.source} -c -o #{t.name}&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Because of a <em>quirk</em> in Ruby syntax, parenthesis are
required on <b>rule</b> when the first argument is a regular expression.
</p>
<p>
The following rule might be used for Java files &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  rule '.java' =&gt; [
    proc { |tn| tn.sub(/\.class$/, '.java').sub(/^classes\//, 'src/') }
  ] do |t|
    java_compile(t.source, t.name)
  end
</pre>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> <tt>java_compile</tt> is a hypothetical method that invokes
the java compiler.
</p>
<h2>Importing Dependencies</h2>
<p>
Any ruby file (including other rakefiles) can be included with a standard
Ruby <tt>require</tt> command. The rules and declarations in the required
file are just added to the definitions already accumulated.
</p>
<p>
Because the files are loaded <em>before</em> the rake targets are
evaluated, the loaded files must be &quot;ready to go&quot; when the rake
command is invoked. This make generated dependency files difficult to use.
By the time rake gets around to updating the dependencies file, it is too
late to load it.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>import</tt> command addresses this by specifying a file to be
loaded <em>after</em> the main rakefile is loaded, but <em>before</em> any
targets on the command line are specified. In addition, if the file name
matches an explicit task, that task is invoked before loading the file.
This allows dependency files to be generated and used in a single rake
command invocation.
</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
  require 'rake/loaders/makefile'

  file &quot;.depends.mf&quot; =&gt; [SRC_LIST] do |t|
    sh &quot;makedepend -f- -- #{CFLAGS} -- #{t.prerequisites} &gt; #{t.name}&quot;
  end

  import &quot;.depends.mf&quot;
</pre>
<p>
If &quot;.depends&quot; does not exist, or is out of date w.r.t. the source
files, a new &quot;.depends&quot; file is generated using
<tt>makedepend</tt> before loading.
</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
Standard Ruby comments (beginning with &quot;#&quot;) can be used anywhere
it is legal in Ruby source code, including comments for tasks and rules.
However, if you wish a task to be described using the &quot;-T&quot;
switch, then you need to use the <tt>desc</tt> command to describe the
task.
</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
  desc &quot;Create a distribution package&quot;
  task :package =&gt; [ ... ] do ... end
</pre>
<p>
The &quot;-T&quot; switch (or &quot;&#8212;tasks&quot; if you like to spell
things out) will display a list of tasks that have a defined comment. If
you use <tt>desc</tt> to describe your major tasks, you have a
semi-automatic way of generating a summary of your Rake file.
</p>
<pre>
  traken$ rake -T
  (in /home/.../rake)
  rake clean            # Remove any temporary products.
  rake clobber          # Remove any generated file.
  rake clobber_rdoc     # Remove rdoc products
  rake contrib_test     # Run tests for contrib_test
  rake default          # Default Task
  rake install          # Install the application
  rake lines            # Count lines in the main rake file
  rake rdoc             # Build the rdoc HTML Files
  rake rerdoc           # Force a rebuild of the RDOC files
  rake test             # Run tests
  rake testall          # Run all test targets
</pre>
<p>
Only tasks with descriptions will be displayed with the &quot;-T&quot;
switch. Use &quot;-P&quot; (or &quot;&#8212;prereqs&quot;) to get a list of
all tasks and their prerequisites.
</p>
<h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>
As projects grow (and along with it, the number of tasks), it is common for
task names to begin to clash. For example, if you might have a main program
and a set of sample programs built by a single Rakefile. By placing the
tasks related to the main program in one namespace, and the tasks for
building the sample programs in a different namespace, the task names will
not will not interfer with each other.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  namespace &quot;main&quot;
    task :build do
      # Build the main program
    end
  end

  namespace &quot;samples&quot; do
    task :build do
      # Build the sample programs
    end
  end

  task :build =&gt; [&quot;main:build&quot;, &quot;samples:build&quot;]
</pre>
<p>
Referencing a task in a separate namespace can be achieved by prefixing the
task name with the namespace and a colon (e.g. &quot;main:build&quot;
refers to the :build task in the <tt>main</tt> namespace). Nested
namespaces are supported, so
</p>
<p>
Note that the name given in the <tt>task</tt> command is always the
unadorned task name without any namespace prefixes. The <tt>task</tt>
command always defines a task in the current namespace.
</p>
<h3>FileTasks</h3>
<p>
File task names are not scoped by the namespace command. Since the name of
a file task is the name of an actual file in the file system, it makes
little sense to include file task names in name space. Directory tasks
(created by the <tt>directory</tt> command) are a type of file task and are
also not affected by namespaces.
</p>
<h3>Name Resolution</h3>
<p>
When looking up a task name, rake will start with the current namespace and
attempt to find the name there. If it fails to find a name in the current
namespace, it will search the parent namespaces until a match is found (or
an error occurs if there is no match).
</p>
<p>
The &quot;rake&quot; namespace is a special implicit namespace that refers
to the toplevel names.
</p>
<p>
If a task name begins with a &quot;^&quot; character, the name resolution
will start in the parent namespace. Multiple &quot;^&quot; characters are
allowed.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example file with multiple :run tasks and how various names
resolve in different locations.
</p>
<pre>
  task :run

  namespace &quot;one&quot; do
    task :run

    namespace &quot;two&quot; do
      task :run

      # :run            =&gt; &quot;one:two:run&quot;
      # &quot;two:run&quot;       =&gt; &quot;one:two:run&quot;
      # &quot;one:two:run&quot;   =&gt; &quot;one:two:run&quot;
      # &quot;one:run&quot;       =&gt; &quot;one:run&quot;
      # &quot;^run&quot;          =&gt; &quot;one:run&quot;
      # &quot;^^run&quot;         =&gt; &quot;rake:run&quot; (the top level task)
      # &quot;rake:run&quot;      =&gt; &quot;rake:run&quot; (the top level task)
    end

    # :run       =&gt; &quot;one:run&quot;
    # &quot;two:run&quot;  =&gt; &quot;one:two:run&quot;
    # &quot;^run&quot;     =&gt; &quot;rake:run&quot;
  end

  # :run           =&gt; &quot;rake:run&quot;
  # &quot;one:run&quot;      =&gt; &quot;one:run&quot;
  # &quot;one:two:run&quot;  =&gt; &quot;one:two:run&quot;
</pre>
<h2>FileLists</h2>
<p>
FileLists are the way Rake manages lists of files. You can treat a FileList
as an array of strings for the most part, but FileLists support some
additional operations.
</p>
<h3>Creating a FileList</h3>
<p>
Creating a file list is easy. Just give it the list of file names:
</p>
<pre>
   fl = FileList['file1.rb', file2.rb']
</pre>
<p>
Or give it a glob pattern:
</p>
<pre>
   fl = FileList['*.rb']
</pre>
<h2>Odds and Ends</h2>
<h3>do/end verses { }</h3>
<p>
Blocks may be specified with either a <tt>do</tt>/<tt>end</tt> pair, or
with curly braces in Ruby. We <em>strongly</em> recommend using
<tt>do</tt>/<tt>end</tt> to specify the actions for tasks and rules.
Because the rakefile idiom tends to leave off parenthesis on the
task/file/rule methods, unusual ambiguities can arise when using curly
braces.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose that the method <tt>object_files</tt> returns a list
of object files in a project. Now we use <tt>object_files</tt> as the
prerequistes in a rule specified with actions in curly braces.
</p>
<pre>
  # DON'T DO THIS!
  file &quot;prog&quot; =&gt; object_files {
    # Actions are expected here (but it doesn't work)!
  }
</pre>
<p>
Because curly braces have a higher precedence than
<tt>do</tt>/<tt>end</tt>, the block is associated with the
<tt>object_files</tt> method rather than the <tt>file</tt> method.
</p>
<p>
This is the proper way to specify the task &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  # THIS IS FINE
  file &quot;prog&quot; =&gt; object_files do
    # Actions go here
  end
</pre>
