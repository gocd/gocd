class Array
  # Wraps its argument in an array unless it is already an array (or array-like).
  #
  # Specifically:
  #
  # * If the argument is +nil+ an empty list is returned.
  # * Otherwise, if the argument responds to +to_ary+ it is invoked, and its result returned.
  # * Otherwise, returns an array with the argument as its single element.
  #
  #     Array.wrap(nil)       # => []
  #     Array.wrap([1, 2, 3]) # => [1, 2, 3]
  #     Array.wrap(0)         # => [0]
  #
  # This method is similar in purpose to <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>, but there are some differences:
  #
  # * If the argument responds to +to_ary+ the method is invoked. <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>
  #   moves on to try +to_a+ if the returned value is +nil+, but <tt>Array.wrap</tt> returns
  #   +nil+ right away.
  # * If the returned value from +to_ary+ is neither +nil+ nor an +Array+ object, <tt>Kernel#Array</tt>
  #   raises an exception, while <tt>Array.wrap</tt> does not, it just returns the value.
  # * It does not call +to_a+ on the argument, but returns an empty array if argument is +nil+.
  #
  # The second point is easily explained with some enumerables:
  #
  #   Array(foo: :bar)      # => [[:foo, :bar]]
  #   Array.wrap(foo: :bar) # => [{:foo=>:bar}]
  #
  # There's also a related idiom that uses the splat operator:
  #
  #   [*object]
  #
  # which returns <tt>[]</tt> for +nil+, but calls to <tt>Array(object)</tt> otherwise.
  #
  # The differences with <tt>Kernel#Array</tt> explained above
  # apply to the rest of <tt>object</tt>s.
