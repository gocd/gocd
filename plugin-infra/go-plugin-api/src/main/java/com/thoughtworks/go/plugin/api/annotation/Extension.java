/**
 * Annotation that marks a type an extension implementation.

 * Intended for use by plugin developers to mark an implementation
 * of the Go extension API.
 * When a type is marked with annotation the type will be loaded
 * by the plugin framework and will receive the lifecycle callbacks
 * of the Go API interfaces it implements.
 * </p>
 * Please refer to the Go Plugin documentation for more details on how to use
 * this annotation.
