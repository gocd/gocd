# [0.9.12] - November 26th, 2017

[0.9.12]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.11...v0.9.12

  specified by `yard doc` command.

# [0.9.11] - November 23rd, 2017

[0.9.11]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.10...v0.9.11

- Fixed security issue in `--readme` that allowed for arbitrary file reads on
  disk. Credit to ztz <ztz@ztz.me> for discovering this issue.
- Improved styling for inline code blocks (#1142).

# [0.9.10] - November 18th, 2017

[0.9.10]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.9...v0.9.10

  code if there are any warnings (#1093).

- Added support new ripper AST tokens (#1104, #1124).
- Fixed an issue where `@see (obj)` reference tags would fail (#1111)
- Fix sorting in `yard stats` (#1123).

# [0.9.9] - April 23rd, 2017

[0.9.9]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.8...v0.9.9

# [0.9.6] - January 7th, 2017

[0.9.6]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.5...v0.9.6

- Removed official support for Ruby 1.x (1.8/1.9). YARD can still be installed
  in these versions, but support is not guaranteed. Simple bug fixes may still
  be considered via pull request only. Issues without code will be automatically
  closed.
- Added {YARD::Tags::Tag#explain_types} returning a plain English summary
  of the type specification of a given tag. Also adds {YARD::Tags::TypesExplainer}
  as an implementation class for the method.
- Added support for automatic linking of constants and method calls of
  Ruby syntax highlighted source code in generated HTML. Also adds the
  {YARD::Parser::Ruby::TokenResolver} implementation class to iterate over
  tokenized code with extra resolved object information.
- Added support for compound constant assignments (`A::B::C = true`).
- Added `LibraryVersion#yardoc_file_for_SOURCE` callback method for sources with
  a pre-determined yardoc file location. Implement this method instead of
  manually setting `library.yardoc_file = ...` in your load method (you can
  still assign the attribute manually).
- Use RubyGems 2.x+ API to query gems when available instead of using backport.
- Various bug fixes

# [0.9.5] - July 22nd, 2016

[0.9.5]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.4...v0.9.5

- `yard doc` will now generate `.yardoc/processing` and `.yardoc/complete` files
  to allow other tools to properly detect when YARD is in the middle of parsing
  source files, and when it has completed writing the database.
- Added support for on-demand generation of LibraryVersion objects using the
  `:disk` source type. LibraryVersion objects pointing to a .yardoc database
  directory will now auto-generate if there is a `source_path` attached.
- Added warning for macros attached to non-method objects.
- Fixed a few more parsing errors.

# [0.9.4] - July 21st, 2016

[0.9.4]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.3...v0.9.4

- Minor Ruby file parsing and CSS bug fixes.

# [0.9.3] - July 20th, 2016

[0.9.3]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.3

- Added support for {YARD::Server::RackAdapter} to be mounted under prefix URIs.
- Fixed regression in `yard server -g` that caused static file assets on index
  page to return 404 errors.
- Fixed regression in `yard server -g` index page that disabled scrolling and
  caused other HTML rendering glitches.

# [0.9.2] - July 19th, 2016

[0.9.2]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2

- Added `yard config --gem-install-[yri|yard]` commands which auto-configure
  your `~/.gemrc` file to run yri/yard instead of ri/rdoc on a `gem install`.
- Added support for gemspec metadata key `"yard.run"`, which can be either
  `"yard"` or `"yri"` to run the respective commands on a `gem install`.
- Added `yard doc --no-progress` to hide the progress bar.
- Fix resolution error for compound proxy namespaces.
- YRI will now search across all gem versions (latest first) for the .yardoc
  database.

# [0.9.1] - July 18th, 2016

[0.9.1]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1

- Added "Attributes" section to `yard stats`.
- Added support for RubyGems 2.x `--document=yri,yard` flags. You can now run
  YARD documentation generation against installed gems by running:
  `gem install mygem --document=yard,yri`.
- Added `/static/*` routing for library-specific routing. This enables static
  template files to be served on a per-library basis instead of globally shared
  across the `yard server`.
- Added support for inlining of `{include:*}` syntax. Using this syntax in
  the middle of a docstring paragraph will no longer create a separate paragraph
  for the included text.
- Added support for resolving `{}` syntax in text templates, specifically for
  use in `{include:*}` syntax.
- Improved object resolution logic in `{Foo::Bar}` syntax and {YARD::Registry.resolve}.
  New resolution logic should now more accurately support resolving compound paths
  across namespaces and through the inheritance tree (as Ruby does).
- The `frozen_string_literal: true` comment line in Ruby source files will now be
  excluded from docstrings.
- Added a workaround for https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11485
- Fixed an issue where type using a docstring reference on an `@!attribute` macro
  would be incorrectly parsed as a type specifier. This change updates the tag
  parser to disallow newlines between the tag name and opening bracket of the
  type specification.
- Fixed an issue where `--embed-mixins` would improperly embed methods from
  inherited classes instead of modules.
- Fixed various parsing errors and YARD exceptions.
- Added a warning for modules or classes being redefined as constants.
- Reverted stripping of HTML in {YARD::Docstring#summary}.
- Added optimization to remove initial docstring parse on newly created code objects.
- {YARD::CodeObjects::Base#format} now passes the :type parameter to templates.
- Hide methods with filtered namespaces in Method Listing.

# [0.9.0] - July 4th, 2016

[0.9.0]: https://github.com/lsegal/yard/compare/v0.8.7.6...v0.9.0

Special thanks to Alex Dowad, MSP-Greg, and Alex McLain for their extended
contributions to this version.

- (Breaking Change): Replaced default template with an updated "frameless" version.
  This change may affect backward compatibility if custom templates made modifications
  to `default/fulldoc/html`, specifically the index or navigation lists.
- Added support for Ruby 2.1+ decorator style method declaration syntax. YARD now
  supports:
    private def foo(x, y) end
- Metadata headers in extra files can now be escaped from rendering by enclosing them
  in HTML comment blocks (`<!--\n @metadata here... \n-->`). Ensure that the opening
  comment tag is alone on the first line of the file to use this functionality.
- Improved parsing of various CRuby coding styles.
- Fixed issue with binary image assets when using `yard server`.
- Fixed deprecation warnings from Rake 10.x.
- Tests updated for RSpec 3.

  by appending "- extra files here" after regular source files. Example:

        yardoc --private lib/**/*.rb - FAQ LICENSE

  power of YARD and what to expect from the syntax (Yardoc style meta tags).
