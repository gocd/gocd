      # Historically, a single matcher instance was only checked
      # against a single value. Given that the matcher was only
      # used once, it's been common to memoize some intermediate
      # calculation that is derived from the `actual` value in
      # order to reuse that intermediate result in the failure
      # message.
      #
      # This can cause a problem when using such a matcher as an
      # argument to another matcher in a composed matcher expression,
      # since the matcher instance may be checked against multiple
      # values and produce invalid results due to the memoization.
      #
      # To deal with this, we clone any matchers in `expected` via
      # this method when using `values_match?`, so that any memoization
      # does not "leak" between checks.
