== 2.1 / 2014-01-25

* The IANA media type registry format changed, resulting in updates to most of
  the 1,427 registered MIME types.
  * Many registered MIME types have had some metadata updates due to the change
    in the IANA registry format.
    * MIME types having a publicly available registry application now include a
      link to that file in references.
    * Added +xrefs+ data as discovered (see the API changes noted above).

  but unregistered MIME types and known extensions for those MIME types. This
  has affected many of the available MIME types.
