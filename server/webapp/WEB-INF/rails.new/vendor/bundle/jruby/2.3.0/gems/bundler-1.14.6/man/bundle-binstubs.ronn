=============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`bundle binstubs` <GEM_NAME> [--force] [--path PATH] [--standalone]

## DESCRIPTION

Binstubs are put into `bin`, or the `--path` directory if one has been set.

## OPTIONS

* `--force`:
  Overwrite existing binstubs if they exist.

* `--path`:
  The location to install the specified binstubs to. This defaults to `bin`.

* `--standalone`:
  Makes binstubs that can work without depending on Rubygems or Bundler at
  runtime.

## BUNDLE INSTALL --BINSTUBS

To create binstubs for all the gems in the bundle you can use the `--binstubs`
flag in [bundle install(1)][bundle-install].
