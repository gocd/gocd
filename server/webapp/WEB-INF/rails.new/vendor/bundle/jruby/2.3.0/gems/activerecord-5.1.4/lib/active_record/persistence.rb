    #   # => #<Account id: 1, email: 'account@example.com'>
    #
    # Attributes are reloaded from the database, and caches busted, in
    # particular the associations cache and the QueryCache.
    #
    # If the record no longer exists in the database ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    # is raised. Otherwise, in addition to the in-place modification the method
    # returns +self+ for convenience.
    #
    # The optional <tt>:lock</tt> flag option allows you to lock the reloaded record:
    #
    #   reload(lock: true) # reload with pessimistic locking
    #
    # Reloading is commonly used in test suites to test something is actually
    # written to the database, or when some action modifies the corresponding
    # row in the database but not the object in memory:
    #
    #   assert account.deposit!(25)
    #   assert_equal 25, account.credit        # check it is updated in memory
    #   assert_equal 25, account.reload.credit # check it is also persisted
    #

    #   def with_optimistic_retry
    #     begin
    #       yield
    #     rescue ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
