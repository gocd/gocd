# (which measures the true angular orientation of the earth in space); see

# There were no leap seconds before 1972, because the official mechanism
# accounting for the discrepancy between atomic time and the earth's rotation
# did not exist until the early 1970s.

# The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so lines
# will typically look like:
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	R/S
# or
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	R/S

# If the leapsecond is Rolling (R) the given time is local time.
# If the leapsecond is Stationary (S) the given time is UTC.
