    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +id+ - This should be the id or an array of ids to be updated.
    # * +attributes+ - This should be a hash of attributes or an array of hashes.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   # Updates one record
    #   Person.update(15, user_name: 'Samuel', group: 'expert')

    #   # Updates multiple records

    #   people = Person.where(group: 'expert')
    #   people.update(group: 'masters')
    #
    # Note: Updating a large number of records will run an
    # UPDATE query for each record, which may cause a performance
    # issue. So if it is not needed to run callbacks for each update, it is
    # preferred to use #update_all for updating all records using
    # a single query.

    # Destroys the records by instantiating each
    # record and calling its {#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy] method.
    # Each object's callbacks are executed (including <tt>:dependent</tt> association options).
    # Returns the collection of objects that were destroyed; each will be frozen, to
    # reflect that no changes should be made (since they can't be persisted).
    #
    # Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and deletion of each
    # record can be time consuming when you're removing many records at
    # once. It generates at least one SQL +DELETE+ query per record (or
    # possibly more, to enforce your callbacks). If you want to delete many
    # rows quickly, without concern for their associations or callbacks, use
    # #delete_all instead.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   Person.where(age: 0..18).destroy_all
    def destroy_all
      records.each(&:destroy).tap { reset }
    end

    # Destroy an object (or multiple objects) that has the given id. The object is instantiated first,
    # therefore all callbacks and filters are fired off before the object is deleted. This method is
    # less efficient than #delete but allows cleanup methods and other actions to be run.
    #
    # This essentially finds the object (or multiple objects) with the given id, creates a new object
    # from the attributes, and then calls destroy on it.
    #
    # ==== Parameters
    #
    # * +id+ - Can be either an Integer or an Array of Integers.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    #   # Destroy a single object
    #   Todo.destroy(1)
    #
    #   # Destroy multiple objects
    #   todos = [1,2,3]
    #   Todo.destroy(todos)

        id.map { |one_id| destroy(one_id) }
      else

      end
    end

    # Deletes the records without instantiating the records
    # first, and hence not calling the {#destroy}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy]
    # method nor invoking callbacks.
    # This is a single SQL DELETE statement that goes straight to the database, much more
    # efficient than #destroy_all. Be careful with relations though, in particular
    # <tt>:dependent</tt> rules defined on associations are not honored. Returns the
    # number of rows affected.
    #
    #   Post.where(person_id: 5).where(category: ['Something', 'Else']).delete_all
    #
    # Both calls delete the affected posts all at once with a single DELETE statement.
    # If you need to destroy dependent associations or call your <tt>before_*</tt> or
    # +after_destroy+ callbacks, use the #destroy_all method instead.
    #
    # If an invalid method is supplied, #delete_all raises an ActiveRecordError:
    #
