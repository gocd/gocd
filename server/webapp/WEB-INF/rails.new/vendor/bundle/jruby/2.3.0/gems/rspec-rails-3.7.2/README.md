# rspec-rails [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rspec/rspec-rails.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/rspec/rspec-rails) [![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/rspec/rspec-rails.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rspec/rspec-rails)
**rspec-rails** is a testing framework for Rails 3.x, 4.x and 5.0.

Use **[rspec-rails 1.x](http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails)** for Rails
2.x.

## Installation

Add `rspec-rails` to **both** the `:development` and `:test` groups in the
`Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.6'
end
```

Want to run against the `master` branch? You'll need to include the dependent
RSpec repos as well. Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
%w[rspec-core rspec-expectations rspec-mocks rspec-rails rspec-support].each do |lib|
  gem lib, :git => "https://github.com/rspec/#{lib}.git", :branch => 'master'
end
```

Download and install by running:

```
bundle install
```

Initialize the `spec/` directory (where specs will reside) with:

```
rails generate rspec:install
```

This adds the following files which are used for configuration:

- `.rspec`
- `spec/spec_helper.rb`
- `spec/rails_helper.rb`

Check the comments in each file for more information.

Use the `rspec` command to run your specs:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

By default the above will run all `_spec.rb` files in the `spec` directory. For
more details about this see the [RSpec spec file
docs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/spec-files).

To run only a subset of these specs use the following command:

```
# Run only model specs
bundle exec rspec spec/models

# Run only specs for AccountsController
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/accounts_controller_spec.rb

# Run only spec on line 8 of AccountsController
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/accounts_controller_spec.rb:8
```

Specs can also be run via `rake spec`, though this command may be slower to
start than the `rspec` command.

In Rails 4, you may want to create a binstub for the `rspec` command so it can
be run via `bin/rspec`:

```
bundle binstubs rspec-core
```

### Upgrade Note

For detailed information on the general RSpec 3.x upgrade process see the
[RSpec Upgrade docs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs/upgrade).

There are three particular `rspec-rails` specific changes to be aware of:

1. [The default helper files created in RSpec 3.x have changed](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/upgrade#default-helper-files)
2. [File-type inference disabled by default](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/upgrade#file-type-inference-disabled)
3. [Rails 4.x `ActiveRecord::Migration` pending migration checks](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/upgrade#pending-migration-checks)
4. Extraction of `stub_model` and `mock_model` to
   [`rspec-activemodel-mocks`](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-activemodel-mocks)
5. In Rails 5.x, controller testing has been moved to its own gem which is [rails-controller-testing](https://github.com/rails/rails-controller-testing). Using `assigns` in your controller specs without adding this gem will no longer work.
6. `rspec-rails` now includes two helpers, `spec_helper.rb` and `rails_helper.rb`.
   `spec_helper.rb` is the conventional RSpec configuration helper, whilst the
    Rails specific loading and bootstrapping has moved to the `rails_helper.rb`
    file. Rails specs now need this file required beforehand either at the top
    of the specific file (recommended) or a common configuration location such
    as your `.rspec` file.

Please see the [RSpec Rails Upgrade
docs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/upgrade) for full
details.

**NOTE:** Generators run in RSpec 3.x will now require `rails_helper` instead
of `spec_helper`.

### Generators

Once installed, RSpec will generate spec files instead of Test::Unit test files
when commands like `rails generate model` and `rails generate controller` are
used.

You may also invoke RSpec generators independently. For instance,
running `rails generate rspec:model` will generate a model spec. For more
information, see [list of all
generators](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/generators).

## Contributing

Once you've set up the environment, you'll need to cd into the working
directory of whichever repo you want to work in. From there you can run the
specs and cucumber features, and make patches.

NOTE: You do not need to use rspec-dev to work on a specific RSpec repo. You
can treat each RSpec repo as an independent project.
Please see the following files:

## Model Specs

Use model specs to describe behavior of models (usually ActiveRecord-based) in
the application.

Model specs default to residing in the `spec/models` folder. Tagging any
context with the metadata `:type => :model` treats its examples as model
specs.

For example:

```ruby
require "rails_helper"

RSpec.describe User, :type => :model do
  it "orders by last name" do
    lindeman = User.create!(first_name: "Andy", last_name: "Lindeman")
    chelimsky = User.create!(first_name: "David", last_name: "Chelimsky")

    expect(User.ordered_by_last_name).to eq([chelimsky, lindeman])
  end
end
```

For more information, see [cucumber scenarios for model
specs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/model-specs).

## Request Specs

Use request specs to describe the client-facing behavior of the application â€”
specifically, the HTTP response to be issued for a given request (a.k.a.
integration tests). Since such client-facing behavior encompasses controller
actions, this is the type of spec to use for controller testing.

Request specs default to residing in the `spec/requests`, `spec/api`, and
`spec/integration` directories. Tagging any context with the metadata `:type =>
:request` treats its examples as request specs.

Request specs mix in behavior from
[ActionDispatch::Integration::Runner](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Integration/Runner.html),
which is the basis for [Rails' integration
tests](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#integration-testing).

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "home page", :type => :request do
  it "displays the user's username after successful login" do
    user = User.create!(:username => "jdoe", :password => "secret")
    get "/login"
    assert_select "form.login" do
      assert_select "input[name=?]", "username"
      assert_select "input[name=?]", "password"
      assert_select "input[type=?]", "submit"
    end

    post "/login", :username => "jdoe", :password => "secret"
    assert_select ".header .username", :text => "jdoe"
  end
end
```

The above example uses only standard Rails and RSpec APIs, but many
RSpec/Rails users like to use extension libraries like
[FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) and
[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara):

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "home page", :type => :request do
  it "displays the user's username after successful login" do
    user = FactoryBot.create(:user, :username => "jdoe", :password => "secret")
    visit "/login"
    fill_in "Username", :with => "jdoe"
    fill_in "Password", :with => "secret"
    click_button "Log in"

    expect(page).to have_selector(".header .username", :text => "jdoe")
  end
end
```

FactoryBot decouples this example from changes to validation requirements,
which can be encoded into the underlying factory definition without requiring
changes to this example.

Among other benefits, Capybara binds the form post to the generated HTML, which
means we don't need to specify them separately. Note that Capybara's DSL as
shown is, by default, only available in specs in the spec/features directory.
For more information, see the [Capybara integration
docs](http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-rails/file/Capybara.md).

There are several other Ruby libs that implement the factory pattern or provide
a DSL for request specs (a.k.a. acceptance or integration specs), but
FactoryBot and Capybara seem to be the most widely used. Whether you choose
these or other libs, we strongly recommend using something for each of these
roles.

For more information, see [cucumber scenarios for request
specs](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/request-specs/request-spec).

## Controller Specs

Controller specs can be used to describe the behavior of Rails controllers. As
of version 3.5, however, controller specs are discouraged in favor of request
specs (which also focus largely on controllers, but capture other critical
aspects of application behavior as well). Controller specs will continue to be
supported until at least version 4.0 (see the [release
notes](http://rspec.info/blog/2016/07/rspec-3-5-has-been-released/#rails-support-for-rails-5)
for details).

For more information, see [cucumber scenarios for controller
specs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/controller-specs).

## Feature Specs

Feature specs test your application from the outside by simulating a browser.
[`capybara`](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) is used to manage the
simulated browser.

Feature specs default to residing in the `spec/features` folder. Tagging any
context with the metadata `:type => :feature` treats its examples as feature
specs.

Feature specs mix in functionality from the capybara gem, thus they require
`capybara` to use. To use feature specs, add `capybara` to the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "capybara"
```

For more information, see the [cucumber scenarios for feature
specs](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-4/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec).

## Mailer specs

By default Mailer specs reside in the `spec/mailers` folder. Adding the metadata
`:type => :mailer` to any context makes its examples be treated as mailer specs.

`ActionMailer::TestCase::Behavior` is mixed into your mailer specs.

```ruby
require "rails_helper"

RSpec.describe Notifications, :type => :mailer do
  describe "notify" do
    let(:mail) { Notifications.signup }

    it "renders the headers" do
      expect(mail.subject).to eq("Signup")
      expect(mail.to).to eq(["to@example.org"])
      expect(mail.from).to eq(["from@example.com"])
    end

    it "renders the body" do
      expect(mail.body.encoded).to match("Hi")
    end
  end
end
```

For more information, see the [cucumber scenarios for mailer specs
](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-4/docs/mailer-specs).

## Job specs

Tagging a context with the metadata `:type => :job` treats its examples as job
specs. Typically these specs will live in `spec/jobs`.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe UploadBackupsJob, :type => :job do
  describe "#perform_later" do
    it "uploads a backup" do
      ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :test
      UploadBackupsJob.perform_later('backup')
      expect(UploadBackupsJob).to have_been_enqueued
    end
  end
end
```

For more information, see the [cucumber scenarios for job specs
](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/job-specs).

## View specs

View specs default to residing in the `spec/views` folder. Tagging any context
with the metadata `:type => :view` treats its examples as view specs.

View specs mix in `ActionView::TestCase::Behavior`.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "events/index", :type => :view do
  it "renders _event partial for each event" do
    assign(:events, [double(Event), double(Event)])
    render
    expect(view).to render_template(:partial => "_event", :count => 2)
  end
end

RSpec.describe "events/show", :type => :view do
  it "displays the event location" do
    assign(:event, Event.new(:location => "Chicago"))
    render
    expect(rendered).to include("Chicago")
  end
end
```

View specs infer the controller name and path from the path to the view
template. e.g. if the template is `events/index.html.erb` then:

```ruby
controller.controller_path == "events"
controller.request.path_parameters[:controller] == "events"
```

This means that most of the time you don't need to set these values. When
spec'ing a partial that is included across different controllers, you _may_
need to override these values before rendering the view.

To provide a layout for the render, you'll need to specify _both_ the template
and the layout explicitly. For example:

```ruby
render :template => "events/show", :layout => "layouts/application"
```

### `assign(key, val)`

Use this to assign values to instance variables in the view:

```ruby
assign(:widget, Widget.new)
render
```

The code above assigns `Widget.new` to the `@widget` variable in the view, and
then renders the view.

Note that because view specs mix in `ActionView::TestCase` behavior, any
instance variables you set will be transparently propagated into your views
(similar to how instance variables you set in controller actions are made
available in views). For example:

```ruby
@widget = Widget.new
render # @widget is available inside the view
```

RSpec doesn't officially support this pattern, which only works as a
side-effect of the inclusion of `ActionView::TestCase`. Be aware that it may be
made unavailable in the future.

#### Upgrade note

```ruby
# rspec-rails-1.x
assigns[key] = value

# rspec-rails-2.x+
assign(key, value)
```

### `rendered`

This represents the rendered view.

```ruby
render
expect(rendered).to match /Some text expected to appear on the page/
```

#### Upgrade note

```ruby
# rspec-rails-1.x
render
response.should xxx

# rspec-rails-2.x+
render
rendered.should xxx

# rspec-rails-2.x+ with expect syntax
render
expect(rendered).to xxx
```

## Routing specs

Routing specs default to residing in the `spec/routing` folder. Tagging any
context with the metadata `:type => :routing` treats its examples as routing
specs.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "routing to profiles", :type => :routing do
  it "routes /profile/:username to profile#show for username" do
    expect(:get => "/profiles/jsmith").to route_to(
      :controller => "profiles",
      :action => "show",
      :username => "jsmith"
    )
  end

  it "does not expose a list of profiles" do
    expect(:get => "/profiles").not_to be_routable
  end
end
```

### Upgrade note

`route_for` from rspec-rails-1.x is gone. Use `route_to` and `be_routable`
instead.

## Helper specs

Helper specs default to residing in the `spec/helpers` folder. Tagging any
context with the metadata `:type => :helper` treats its examples as helper
specs.

Helper specs mix in ActionView::TestCase::Behavior. A `helper` object is
provided which mixes in the helper module being spec'd, along with
`ApplicationHelper` (if present).

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe EventsHelper, :type => :helper do
  describe "#link_to_event" do
    it "displays the title, and formatted date" do
      event = Event.new("Ruby Kaigi", Date.new(2010, 8, 27))
      # helper is an instance of ActionView::Base configured with the
      # EventsHelper and all of Rails' built-in helpers
      expect(helper.link_to_event).to match /Ruby Kaigi, 27 Aug, 2010/
    end
  end
end
```

## Matchers

Several domain-specific matchers are provided to each of the example group
types. Most simply delegate to their equivalent Rails' assertions.

### `be_a_new`

- Available in all specs
- Primarily intended for controller specs

```ruby
expect(object).to be_a_new(Widget)
```

Passes if the object is a `Widget` and returns true for `new_record?`

### `render_template`

- Delegates to Rails' `assert_template`
- Available in request, controller, and view specs

In request and controller specs, apply to the `response` object:

```ruby
expect(response).to render_template("new")
```

In view specs, apply to the `view` object:

```ruby
expect(view).to render_template(:partial => "_form", :locals => { :widget => widget } )
```

### `redirect_to`

- Delegates to `assert_redirect`
- Available in request and controller specs

```ruby
expect(response).to redirect_to(widgets_path)
```

### `route_to`

- Delegates to Rails' `assert_routing`
- Available in routing and controller specs

```ruby
expect(:get => "/widgets").to route_to(:controller => "widgets", :action => "index")
```

### `be_routable`

Passes if the path is recognized by Rails' routing. This is primarily intended
to be used with `not_to` to specify standard CRUD routes which should not be
routable.

```ruby
expect(:get => "/widgets/1/edit").not_to be_routable
```

### `have_http_status`

- Passes if `response` has a matching HTTP status code
- The following symbolic status codes are allowed:
  - `Rack::Utils::SYMBOL_TO_STATUS_CODE`
  - One of the defined `ActionDispatch::TestResponse` aliases:
    - `:error`
    - `:missing`
    - `:redirect`
    - `:success`
- Available in controller, feature, and request specs.

In controller and request specs, apply to the `response` object:

```ruby
expect(response).to have_http_status(201)
expect(response).not_to have_http_status(:created)
```

In feature specs, apply to the `page` object:

```ruby
expect(page).to have_http_status(:success)
```

## `rake` tasks

Several rake tasks are provided as a convenience for working with RSpec. To run
the entire spec suite use `rake spec`. To run a subset of specs use the
associated type task, for example `rake spec:models`.

A full list of the available rake tasks can be seen by running `rake -T | grep
spec`.

### Customizing `rake` tasks

If you want to customize the behavior of `rake spec`, you may [define your own
task in the `Rakefile` for your
project](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/command-line/rake-task).
However, you must first clear the task that rspec-rails defined:

```ruby
task("spec").clear
```
