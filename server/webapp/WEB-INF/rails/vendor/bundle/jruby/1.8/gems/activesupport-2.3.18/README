= Active Support -- Utility classes and standard library extensions from Rails

Active Support is a collection of various utility classes and standard library extensions that were found useful
for Rails. All these additions have hence been collected in this bundle as way to gather all that sugar that makes
Ruby sweeter.

== Support

The Active Support homepage is http://www.rubyonrails.com. You can find the Active Support
RubyForge page at http://rubyforge.org/projects/activesupport. And as Jim from Rake says:

   Feel free to submit commits or feature requests.  If you send a patch,
   remember to update the corresponding unit tests.  If fact, I prefer
   new feature to be submitted in the form of new unit tests.

For other information, feel free to ask on the ruby-talk mailing list
(which is mirrored to comp.lang.ruby) or contact mailto:david@loudthinking.com.
