= Rake 10.1.0 Released

== Changes in Version 10.1

=== New Features

* Add support for variable length task argument lists. If more actual
  arguments are supplied than named arguments, then the extra
  arguments values will be in args.extras.

* Application name is not displayed in the help banner. (Previously
  "rake" was hardcoded, now rake-based applications can display their
  own names).

=== Bug Fixes

Bug fixes include:

* Fix backtrace suppression issues.

* Rules now explicit get task arguments passed to them.

* Rename FileList#exclude? to FileList#exclude_from_list? to avoid
  conflict with new Rails method.

* Clean / Clobber tasks now report failure to remove files.

* Plus heaps of internal code cleanup.

== What is Rake

Rake is a build tool similar to the make program in many ways. But
instead of cryptic make recipes, Rake uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.

== Availability

The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems ...

  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)

Otherwise, you can get it from the more from GitHub:

GitHub::    git://github.com/jimweirich/rake.git
