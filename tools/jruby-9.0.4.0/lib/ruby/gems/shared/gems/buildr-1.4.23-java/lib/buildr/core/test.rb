  # The test task controls the entire test lifecycle.
  #
  # You can use the test task in three ways. You can access and configure specific test tasks,
  # e.g. enhance the #compile task, or run code during #setup/#teardown.
  #
  # You can use convenient methods that handle the most common settings. For example,
  # add dependencies using #with, or include only specific tests using #include.
  #
  # You can also enhance this task directly. This task will first execute the #compile task, followed
  # by the #setup task, run the unit tests, any other enhancements, and end by executing #teardown.
  #
  # The test framework is determined based on the available test files, for example, if the test
  # cases are written in Java, then JUnit is selected as the test framework.  You can also select
  # a specific test framework, for example, to use TestNG instead of JUnit:
  #   test.using :testng
